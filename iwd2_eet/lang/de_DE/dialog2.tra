@465   = ~These silver and ebony rings were worn by followers of a charismatic wizard named Aramite of the Northern Wind.  Hundreds of years ago, Aramite started a cult that revered the rulers of ancient Netheril. Seeking to recreate Netherese culture, Aramite and his followers attempted to overtake and excavate a large number of ruins across Faerun.  Aramite successfully recovered many ancient Netherese writings and artifacts that were thought to be long lost.  Rumors state that the Netherese lich king, Larloch, eventually put an end to Aramite and his entire cult.  These rings are among the only items that remain from their organization.

@526   = ~This barely recognizable lump of fish bone has been carried as a good luck charm in Targos for almost twenty years.  The item's history started with the sailor Young Ned of Lonelywood.  On one of his fishing trips near Targos, his small boat capsized near the Maer Dualdon shore.  He held onto his prize catch, an "unbelievably massive" knucklehead trout, despite being charged by a hungry bear when he reached shore.  The bear snatched the majority of the trout away from Ned, leaving him holding the poor fish's tooth-severed head.  Ned walked the rest of the way to Targos and kept the head as evidence of his encounter.  Over time, Ned started to attribute his good fortune as a sailor to his "lucky knucky".  The brigand Marg the Trembler "won" Ned's lucky knucky away from him in a rigged card game.  Ned was bitter over being cheated, but he wasn't willing to stand up to Marg to get it back.  Marg later used the fish head as currency to buy supplies as he hastily fled from Targos.  The man who received the piece of bone held on to it for a few months before handing it off to a friend at the docks.  In the years that followed up to the current date, Ned's "lucky knucky" has been traded, won, or sold to over a dozen people in Targos and, once, in Bremen.

His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north.  Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes.  Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand.  Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew.  At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks.  Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on.  Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days.  A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley.

Targos: Three or fewer ships, perhaps a few dozen infantry and archers.  Two priests at the temple pavilion, with recruits drawn in from Luskan.  The goblin's seizure of the waterways seems to have closed off the passage of further reinforcements.  I have heard no mention of planned reinforcements from elsewhere into the city.  The diviner in Targos should be taken care of by our friends from Luskan.

Bremen: The city should fall soon.  Targos is unable to move ships across the bay thanks to our scrag allies.  According to wounded soldiers from Bremen, they will not be able to hold out.  You should be able to pull in forces from the north without worrying about attacks from Bremen.

Bryn Shander: With our forces in the field and the Shaengarne Ford held, the capital is unable to effectively provide the peripheral towns with supplies.  The bugbears' use of hit and run tactics against caravans moving between the Ten-Towns has made it almost impossible for them to reinforce each other.  Lonelywood has sent almost all of its able-bodied men south to Bryn Shander instead of sending them to Targos.  The same has happened in Easthaven.  Both towns should be ripe for taking should we choose to enlarge our grasp of the region.  Perhaps three to four hundred men wait in Bryn Shander along with a handful of volunteers from Clan Battlehammer.  Most of those are militia, with a few experienced mercenaries among them.  We need not worry about Silverymoon and the other communities to the east.  Only two volunteers have arrived, and those are already out of the action.~
@626   = ~This enchanted short sword has been carved from a single piece of shale, its surface smeared with venom drawn from the tongue of a desert serpent.  The venom never dries, giving the sword an unhealthy sheen. 

This short sword is an evil weapon, said to have caused many lingering deaths over the years.  Its name comes from its last known owner, an infamous buccaneer named Letto who preyed on ships traveling upon the Sea of Moving Ice.  It is said that he was caught by the Tribe of the Great Whale in the shadow of Hehnhold's Iceberg, where his ship was hacked apart by the barbarians' great axes and the crew set aflame with burning pitch.  When the battle was over, only driftwood remained.  One of the pieces of his ship's hull found its way south and the wood was used in the construction of one of the rooms in the upper story of the Weeping Widow Inn.  The short sword has been buried within the timber for almost thirty or more years, waiting for someone to find it again and use it in Letto's name.

A moonblade bypasses armor and strikes at a target directly.  The weapon drains life force and leaves no visible wounds, unless the creature is undead.  Undead suffer terrible wounds from a moonblade.  Their substance actually seems to boil away, and they suffer double damage.

Moonblade's of Selune are the favored weapons of the priestesses of Selune.  They are usually granted only to priestesses who serve the church beyond the call of duty.  This weapon was given to Emma Moonblade for her unswerving dedication to the church.

Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades.  It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up.  It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years.  It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough.  People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that did his deeds.  Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword.  One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination.  When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel."  The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon.  Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

Most merchants will not wish to purchase this item, or will do so at a very low price, as they see it as a sacred item of Auril the Frost-Maiden and likely to attract her followers... and her displeasure.

Created during the ceremonies of the Coming Storm (the onset of winter) to Auril, these robes are specially created to resist flames and allow the wearer to resist any attempt to stop or hold them. Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, whether Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells and the like.

Typically the size of a human adolescent, Grand Raiks are capable of putting up a great fight against the fishermen who seek them out.  Unlike Lesser Raiks, Grand Raiks are very aggressive towards fellow fish in their territory, rarely stopping until they die or the intruders have fled.  Grand Raiks have been known to attack fish three times their size.  One fisherman from Selgaunt even claimed that he saw a Grand Raik attack and kill a Mottled Sidi Octopus..."

@3100  = ~This deceptively mundane looking battleaxe has a short but strange history.  According to philosophers of magic, Faith Killer was enchanted by the non-belief of its owner, the warrior Erion the Skeptic.  A rarity in Faerun, Erion was a man who denied the existence of holy magic and the gods themselves.  He was known for his attempts to prove that priests were charlatans and holy magic was, in actuality, a different form of standard magic.  Sages believe that Erion's intense opposition to holy men and women actually generated sympathetic magical powers in his weapon.  Priests of Selune in Westgate confiscated the axe when they killed Erion in self-defense.  It is currently believed that Erion is one of the unbelievers used as a building block in Myrkul's Bone Castle.

"... we Eldathyn believe that the only real way to live honestly is to resist the temptation to strike out in anger when things are against us.  Violence arises from suffering and, as a result, can do nothing but cause more suffering in its occurrence.  Some of our critics point to the state of nature to invalidate our philosophy.  Some believe that the existence of storms and tremors in nature proves that nature is inherently violent.

There is a simple argument against this, however.  Nature is a gift from the gods, but it functions as an independent system, a science, if you will.  Nature is not inherently violent because disposition towards violence is a property only thinking beings possess.  While there are violent acts in nature, nature is not inherently violent.  Nature is simply nature... "

Unfortunately, these bumbling buffoons haven't spent enough time researching all of the different types of ivy to learn their subtle differences.  Why, just the other day, some fool on the hill told me that Jangling Bell Ivy should be planted in relatively moist soil next to Blossoming Garters.  As any ivy scholar worth his weight in dirt knows, Blossoming Garters require such a huge amount of water that one would drown the Jangling Bell just by tending to the Garters.

"... our principle stance is one of rejection.  The fundamental beliefs of the churches of fury are anathema to our own.  The Gods of Fury stress everything that is selfish, physically abusive, and destructive.  The Malarites care only for proving their temporal power through the senseless butchering of animals.  The Aurilites seem to delight in causing death by freezing whenever possible, removing every shred of heat from their domains.  Priests of Talos simply revel in destruction for its own sake and their own personal pleasure.  Our brothers and sisters in the church of Umberlee cause havoc with the waves for the sole reason of terrifying travelers and fishermen into bowing before their childish god.  As much as we Eldathyn might denounce the beliefs of these religions, there is an even greater question to be asked.  What kind of afterlife can these self-serving priests expect to find in the domains of their self-serving gods?"

@3317  = ~These ancient helms were once common among the Reghedmen barbarians who came to what is now known as Icewind Dale.  The design of the armor is relatively simple: a plain iron helm with a hinged faceplate.  Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate.  The name of the warrior and a one word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask.  The helm was then left in the dead warrior's funeral pyre.  The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man's fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos.  After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests.  Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals.  According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear.  This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe".

The sword has a mild form of empathetic instinct, turning in the wielder's hand to impose itself in the path of melee weapons.

The second monk remained silent for several minutes as the woman disappeared from view.  Finally he spoke to his brother.

Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation.  Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing.  The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night.  As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body.  After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction.  He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks.  Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute.  The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

The monastery was built in the year 1181, founded by a half-human, half-drow slave who escaped his cruel masters in the underdark, fighting his way to the surface world and freedom with nothing more than his bare hands and the very chains that once bound them.

The half-drow's name was Valas Belaem Del Pharm - Valas, Slave of Pharm.  As a child Valas was a house-servant of the Leun, but soon grew into a lean and powerful young adult.  While most families are reluctant to keep such dangerous slaves, Valas was lost in a wager to an opposing family - the Pharm - who kept him alive simply to spite the Leun.  Valas became the greatest champion of the Pharm's gladiator stable - in fact, the greatest of all of the Rilauven stables - before he escaped.  It was then, during the decades spent in the dark city's majestically spired arena of blood sports, that Valas developed his legendary fighting skills.

The book goes on to recount in detail how Valas escapes, surfacing in the Spine of the World at the headwaters of the Black Raven River.  The first men he comes across are the Uthgardt barbarians of the Black Raven Tribe at Raven Rock.  The barbarians don't know what to make of Valas, who shows up out of nowhere with crimson eyes, jet-black skin and hair to match, half-naked and with bloody chains dangling from his wrists.  Naturally, their bravest attack... and are promptly defeated.  The barbarians think him a spirit warrior sent to punish their arrogance and christen him the Black Raven, a name that Valas takes as his own.  They're later saddened but slightly relieved to see him leave.  Valas travels the world as the Black Raven, fights against slavery and imprisonment wherever it's found (making a great deal of enemies in the process), collects a throng of loyal students, teaches them his ideals and martial techniques, and eventually returns with them to the Spine of the World to build the Black Raven Monastery.  He eventually dies quietly of old age, is interred beneath the monastery in a tomb near the underground headwaters of the Black Raven River, and with that his story ends.~

Once you've read this message distribute it to your workers:

The queen has been acting strangely as of late - I believe her mating season may be approaching.  Ergo, from now on keep all males away from her until further notice.  Have her guard the blockade if you'd like.

Regarding the males, keep training them to dig through the ice.  We'll need to excavate larger areas while Nickademus regains his strength so he can build Legionnaire outposts.  Always remember to keep them well rested and well fed; otherwise they'll be useless to us, and may pose a serious threat.  Feel free to train one of them to attack or follow you if you feel in need of protection.

Furthermore, my DELICATE crystal golems are rather expensive and are NOT sources of your amusement!  If I catch ANY of your frosttouches launching rocks at them again you'll have to answer to me personally!

One last thing - stay alert!  According to Sherincal, those Malarite bastards failed us at Shaengarne River, so opposition may strike at any moment.

In Auril's name,
Oria~

@16933 = ~This journal, bound in exotic, jewel-encrusted leather and written with fine ink on parchment made from spider silk, reads as follows:

Where to begin...?  It hath been a tough life, to be sure - even from birth.  Being part of conjoined triplets, separated at the brink of death, has its boons and banes - as does any aspect of life I suppose.  I can hear my sisters' thoughts and feel their pain, but never have I known what it means to be alone - truly alone...

Luskan was a gruff town - unforgiving, even if viewed in its best light.  'Tis certainly no place for three innocent, little women, but the bond we shared kept us together and alive.  Our parents were never around - always chasing the latest job offer or most-favorable rumor just to make ends meet.  With ruffians, bandits, and creatures of the night lurking in every shadowy corner, there were no individuals we could respect... except one - Lysan...

Lysan, a priestess of Auril and fellow Luskanite, shone like a celestial beacon across a sea of eternal darkness, and became our idol and inspiration with little effort.  Her goodwill and fortitude we adored - her adventurousness we admired.  What greatness the four of us would hath achieved - how noble our exploits would hath been in spreading our seeds of compassion throughout the winter land, only to watch them blossom into flowers of love come spring!  The goal was as clear as a crystal trapped within a drop of ice, until...

Where was I when the news pierced our hearts like a javelin hurled from the Nine Hells Itself...?  Lysan... poor, sweet Lysan was slaughtered, like a diseased goblin, in Kresselack's Tomb by a band of villains in heroes' clothing.  Why?!  Because of her beliefs?!  Thirty years hath passed, yet the pain lingers.  At that moment a new goal emerged - her path was now ours, and we immediately joined the church of Auril in town...

Our ambition quickly dwarfed that small temple, so we headed east to join Auril's Breath in Glister.  Ironically that congregation proved too large for us, so we headed north to establish a church of our own, as well as retrace the steps of our martyr, Lysan.  Reinforcing our decision to travel north, we had also heard that the mysterious demon twins we knew of in Luskan were also in that area, so we undoubtedly had to see if those rumors were true...

En route we stumbled upon an envoy from the Legion of the Chimera and were eventually led to Madae.  Despite our humanity, the four of us became instant, though reserved, friends, and 'twas soon obvious that her wants, needs, and desires complimented our own...

The deal was simple - if we guarded the Western Pass against reinforcements to the Ten-Towns, they would destroy Kuldahar and give us its precious Heartstone Gem.  The pieces of our plan were falling into place - all we needed was the right time to seal them together...

That time came during our Coming Storm festival when my sisters and I led our newly formed congregation of one hundred strong in a prayer so profound, Auril Herself blessed us with Her embrace.  The glacier was thus born.  All that remained was the temple's creation - *our* temple - which Nickademus, arch-architect, honored guest and former lover of Oria accomplished with impressive speed and skill...

What an oddity - this temple of his.  Even *I* get lost from time to time.  The dais is an interesting concept, but why must I turn it left north, then right all the way around again just to unleash the abishai to do my bidding?  Still, no effort is too great in pleasing Great Auril by sacrificing prisoners to her to keep the glacier from melting...

Time is short, so the painting - though it seems to possess a mind of its own - is useful when I must quickly cleanse myself before speaking to the Frostmaiden...

The prism is a dangerous device, but what Lady Sherincal wants she gets - still, it keeps prying eyes away from Mother Winter and our treasury, so perchance I judge it too harshly...

Oria's Game Room is a waste of time to me - I hath no time for meaningless combat and see no reason to enter the ethereal realm while confined to its limited boundary.  And *why* Nickademus would install a Mirror of Life Trapping eludes all logic and common sense...!

Nickademus... I wish I could trust him - he does not walk our path.  For his sake, I hope he does not betray us again...~

@24407 = ~The Fall of the Hand of Seldarine

The old ties were broken.  Soon, it all turned into hatred based on racial mistrust.  It was the easiest way either side could explain why the dark horde grew in power with their very own weaponry.  Any hope of working it out in a civil manner was gone.  With the alliance destroyed, conflict was inevitable.  Battle broke between the two races and the darker races spared no time taking full advantage.

The elves were now alone.  The horde continued its attacks and without the aid of the dwarves, the elves found themselves hard pressed.  The other main difficulty was that most of the elven kingdoms to the south were either abandoned or lay in complete ruin.  Reinforcements from their own kind were far and few in between.  It became apparent that the elves were losing and would eventually be overrun.

Larrel sent word to Evermeet, and many of the far away elven kingdoms, that support was needed to keep them alive.  Unfortunately, any reinforcements sent would be months away at best.  The elves had to buy time or face annihilation.

Larrel, left with no choice, began the chain of events that destroyed the Severed Hand and led to the final fall of the elves.  When the dark races breached the final defenses of the Hand, he attempted to cast a mythal in the hope of preserving all that he held dear...

A hand written entry has been appended to this page.  It states:

It is rumored that a dark elf by the name of 'Nym' was the individual truly responsible for the fall of the Hand.  Through magical means he entered the vaults of the dwarves, stole their artifacts, and sold them to the goblinoid armies.  He then sat back and watched as the elves and dwarves destroyed their alliance with accusations of guilt.

It is speculated that Nym did this to remove a significant threat to the drow population in the area of the Hand.  With the elves and dwarves vanquished, the drow were free to claim the territory as their own with no consequence...~

Out of desperation, Larrel attempted to cast a mythal of protection.  Unfortunately, the spell failed with catastrophic results.  Enemy and defender alike were warped into undead, Larrel himself transforming into a baelnorn.

Eventually Larrel and his brethren were laid to rest.  Larrel was forgiven his transgression by Labelas Enoreth, elven god of longevity and time, and at last received peace.  As his spirit left to travel to Arvandor, his physical form crumbled to dust and bone.

When held, the chimes ring together, as if stirred by the wind, and no amount of padding or wrapping seems to silence the flail's chiming.  When swung in combat, the chimes clash like thunder, having a chance of deafening anyone struck by it. 

This weapon is all that remains of Slow Cedric's Gallop, a small frontier settlement located in the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World Mountains.  The settlement is believed to have been overrun by a tribe of orcs in the great winter of 1170 DR, and when the cold season passed, the settlement and the bodies of the townsfolk had been buried beneath great mountains of snow.  When the first travelers braved the Pass in the spring season, they found only the top of the settlement's great stone belltower peeking through the mountainous drifts.  This odd-looking flail was found lying upon the tower's bloodied stone floor, surrounded by the frost-dusted bodies of several dead orcs. 

According to tales, the Black Chimes were a symbol of office of the settlement's Bell Warden, whose duty was two-fold - to ring the warning bell when an enemy was sighted in the pass, and after the warning bell had been rung, to defend the pass with his life.  It is believed the first Bell Warden of Slow Cedric's Gallop was the original creator of the Black Chimes, an enchanted flail that would ring to warn the town of danger at the same time as he leapt into battle against his foes.

@27139 = ~To the northeast of the great tree-town of Kuldahar lies the Vale of Shadows, a valley of crypts and tombs where Kresselack the Black Wolf is said to be buried.  Almost thirty years past, a band of adventurers entered the Vale of Shadows and returned with many relics and treasures taken from the tombs there.  The Left Hand of Darkness is one such item, though its true purpose was not realized when it was discovered.  Considered nothing more than the cast-off bandage of a mummy, it had been used to wrap a gold necklace lying in one of the sarcophagi in the tombs. 

The necklace's wrapping was discarded as soon as the band of adventurers returned to Kuldahar, and as they cast it away, the adventurers joked that it could serve some little boy as a sling if need be.  One of the children of Kuldahar was quick to pick up on this comment, and he kept the sling both for hunting and as a good luck charm for several years.  It is not known if he knew if the wrapping was magical or not, and he attributed the accuracy of the stones cast from it as his own natural ability rather than that of the sling.   

In truth, the Left Hand of Darkness is one of the wrappings from the left hand of one of Kresselack's lieutenants, who had been resurrected as a mummy within the tomb of his lord and served as a guardian against trespassers.  When a stone is placed within the wrapping and spun with great force, the stone will fly straight and true at an enemy.  Furthermore, as long as the wrapping is held in the hand, the wielder is immune to diseases, both magical and mundane.

For many, the tree represents a peaceful symbiosis between town and nature, and the tree is revered as a holy site by druids throughout Faerun. 

When the town of Kuldahar was laid siege by the great evil from the Spine of the World Mountains in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR, the great tree of Kuldahar was buffeted by the great winds and howling storms blasting the region, causing its circle of warmth to recede and snapping off several limbs from the top of the tree.  These limbs were gathered up by the town's residents after the town of Kuldahar was saved, and they were kept in many houses as a symbol of the town's persistence in the face of adversity.  Some of these pieces of the great tree have found their way throughout the Ten-Towns, and the limbs still carry some of the warmth and enchantment of the great tree within them, making them powerful weapons.

According to legend, the Black Raven is a near mythical figure in Uthgardt legends, a punishing spirit from the underworld who emerged on the surface world many years ago to teach the barbarians humility and break their arrogance.  Described as a dark-skinned man with burning eyes and bloodied chains hanging from his wrists, the stories that circle the Black Raven frequently tell of his epic struggles against slavers and injustice throughout the North and the southern kingdoms.  Some historians speculate that the Black Raven may have been a drow or half-drow, but others claim that he was a minor or quasi-deity dedicated to ending slavery and oppression. 

This black sash is made of fine silk, perhaps spider silk, and it is worn looped around the waist.  While worn, it helps the wearer focus in combat, freeing his mind of all distractions and channeling his inner energies to defeat his foes.

@27174 = ~The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North.  The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.

When the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault.  Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces.  One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him.  Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen.  

Hreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes.  In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths.  But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. 

Hreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf.  It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.

Bleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees.  With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking.  "Let the sky wander," he proclaimed, "for my travels are done."  

When the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished.  It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be.

@27178 = ~When the venerable (and senile) red dragon Craum Straug wandered into the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth, the residents (wisely) fled in fear as the dragon began to belch flames, setting the camp on fire and causing cries of alarm to spread throughout the countryside.  After the residents fled, Craum squatted his old bones down upon the blackened buildings, grumbling to himself and snorting flames from his nostrils. 

A few hours and several miles away, the residents of Hornhollow finally decided that someone must go negotiate with the dragon and see what it wanted.  When no volunteers were forthcoming, a lottery was conducted - and the loser, a traveling ministrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was given the dangerous task of attempting to deal with the dragon.  Aznee had lived out his welcome in the camp many nights previous, and the loggers considered it no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly.

Aznee, somewhat absent-minded but of a brave heart, stumbled his way into the camp, and finally mustered the courage to speak with the dragon.  During the (now-famous) exchange that followed, Aznee discovered that Craum, who was somewhat far along in dragon years and in none too good health, was suffering the draconic equivalent of a bad cough, and his hacking and wheezing masked his plaintive attempts to try and find someone, anyone, who could help cure his fits of coughing.  

Seeing a solution, Aznee offered a cure that helped an elderly uncle of his - a sprig of Maiden's Milk flower, that when crushed and administered in a tea, helped quell coughing in a matter of minutes.  Some could undoubtably be found in the forest nearby, Aznee exclaimed, and he set about gathering up several sprigs and preparing them for the dragon.  After lumping them into a great pot, he administered the steaming cauldron to the dragon.

It is suspected that either Craug drank the mixture too fast, or else Aznee had mistaken Bellows Root for Maiden's Milk, but whatever the reason, Craug vomited the mixture back out a few seconds later, setting fire to several acres of the wood and torching poor Aznee where he stood.  After this vomitus belch, Craug ran wild for almost an hour, trying to spit out the remainder of the concoction.  At the end of his rampage, the venerable red dragon fell over dead, the sudden flurry of activity more than his old bones could stand. 

When the loggers came to break down the dragon a day later, they discovered that Craum's bones still carried echoes of his coughing fits, and his entire skeleton creaked and wheezed, even after death.  They struck a deal with a local mage, who bought the dragon's bones and fashioned a series of musical instruments with them, dubbed the "Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon."  These yellow bone pipes are famous throughout the Realms and, when used by a bard, they can be used to spit bursts of flames at opponents.  Unfortunately, even when not in use, the pipes tend to creak and wheeze, attracting the attention of anyone nearby and making attempts at stealth and pick pocketing useless. 

A thin cord made of dragon gut is strung through the pipes, so they can be worn around the neck and can be easily played when danger threatens.  The cord looks charred, as if it was burned recently, and is surprisingly tough.

In a short while, I shall attempt to use the Sight to determine the location of the goblin fortress, and I am writing this note out of fear that obtaining a vision of such a place may tax my spirit greatly, preventing me from returning to the waking world.  I have not told the Lady Elytharra of my attempt at divination, for she would surely stop me... and if any others were to know my intentions, they might seek to poison me, for I fear there are traitors within the town that even now turn their eyes to my destruction.

If you're reading this and I still breathe, then it's not too late to awaken me.

Since it was ostensibly a beneficial magical effect, Ilmryn's natural magic resistance did not help him resist the amulet's power.  When the Weapons Master emerged from the protective sphere, he found himself face to face with over a dozen of the most powerful tanar'ri he had ever seen.  He died screaming, cursing his brother's name.

@27527 = ~This belt is broad and thick, crafted from some otherworldly creature's hide and bound with strips of burnished copper.  Gleaming eerily from the center of the belt is a circular piece of polished green and cream malachite.  The emblem shows, in bas-relief, a fanged, winged serpent with its open mouth facing outward.  Small, thick copper loops run between the thick hide and the stone emblem to hold it in place.  Two thick steel buckles hold the belt together at the back of the wearer.

Investigation reveals that this belt was made four hundred years ago for Factor Dom, a warden for the outer-planar Mercykillers faction.  Known throughout the planes for their vicious definition and application of justice, the Mercykillers are strongest in planar cities like Sigil, the City of Doors.

Dom was a warden of the Prison, Sigil's dumping ground for criminals.  He became legendary within the organization after his involvement in the Great Break.  Members of the rebellious Free League engineered the only mass escape from the Prison in its history.  Over one hundred prisoners managed to get out of the Prison and escape the Lady's Ward, though hundreds more were turned back to their cells or died in their escape.  Dom was stripped of his Factor rank in the Mercykillers for failing to stop the revolt.  In addition, he spent five years in the Prison himself.  When he was set free, he set out on a thirty-year quest to bring every escaped criminal to justice.  By the time Dom had captured, killed, or verified as dead eighty of the one hundred criminals, the remaining twenty banded together to evade him.

When Dom reached the age of sixty-seven, he had this belt made for him to augment his failing strength.  Three years later, he finally captured the last of the prisoners and brought them, kicking and screaming, all the way back to the cell from which they had escaped thirty years earlier.  Dom reported to the current warden, filled out the appropriate paperwork, and fell dead from exhaustion within the hour.

@28388 = ~Easthaven gained certain notoriety in the past many years after the terrible events that occurred there in 1281 DR, the Year of the Cold Soul, and it is the events that plagued the town that drew many historians, seers, and mages to the region seeking to know more of the Ten-Towns and the North.  This tome is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the Ten-Towns nor detail the terrible events that occurred in the Year of the Cold Soul, its intention has been written merely to familiarize the reader with the people and day-to-day life in Easthaven. 

The town of Easthaven is one of the "Ten Towns" in the region known as Icewind Dale.  However, "town" may be a bit misleading for such a small frontier community as Easthaven - at least by southern standards.  Although it has experienced a surge of growth in the past few years, Easthaven is little more than a half-moon of modest dwellings clustered around the shores of the icy Lac Dinneshere.  The primary industry of Easthaven is the exportation of scrimshaw, a highly sought after craft material obtained from the bones of knucklehead trout, and visitors should not be surprised to find that the overall atmosphere of the town can be summed up as a snowy, frontier fishing village.  The buildings of the town are built primarily of timber, and the feel of the town reflects the hearts of the townspeople - nearly everything has a rugged feel to it, somewhat unrefined yet sturdy enough to withstand the harsh climate.  Scattered across the town is tremendous evidence of the town's fishing industry; nets, boats, fish racks litter the town in great abundance.

Easthaven has been forced to rebuild over the past few years after the terrible events in the Year of the Cold Soul.  The Temple of Tempus has been rebuilt, although the relics that were stored within the basement of the temple have been moved south in accordance with the mandate of the high priests of Tempus.  Treasure-seekers or fortune hunters who come to Easthaven hoping to find some of the lost relics or arcane items believed to have left behind should be prepared for disappointment as the snows have been picked clean by visiting mages and thieves over the past twenty or thirty years.  Any scholars or explorers coming to the region should make sure to visit the town of Kuldahar to see the great oak in its splendor.  

Despite many attempts to locate them, there have been no documented sightings of the aquatic elves rumored to live in the depths of Lac Dinneshere.  It is the author's opinion that the existence of these elves is merely one of the local myths intended to draw traders and settlers to the region.~
@28389 = ~The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar.  The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred.  The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning).  According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians' greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago.  Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns.  Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians.  Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction.  It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day. 

What happened to these brave adventurers is unknown.  The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found.  Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again.

@28392 = ~The tiny valley of Kuldahar is nestled within the mountain range known as the Spine of the World, which is situated on the northern expanse of the continent of Faerun.  Its jagged, snow-capped peaks stretch from the Sword Coast in the west all the way east to the Anauroch Desert, separating the northern region known as Icewind Dale from the warmer and more "civilized" lands to the south.  Traditionally, access to Icewind Dale is limited to the caravan route that snakes from the frontier city of Luskan, around the western edge of the Spine of the World, and across the frozen tundra surrounding the Ten Towns of the Dale.  However, there exists another route, Kuldahar Pass, that is less traveled due to the inherent dangers of its geography.  

The route through Kuldahar Pass consists of narrow and winding footpaths, barely wide enough to accommodate pack animals let alone caravan wagons.  The steep, snowy ledges of the pass provide enough of an obstacle to deter even the most enterprising of merchants.  Factor in the ever-present danger from giants and other denizens of the untamed mountain range, and it's a wonder anyone travels the route at all.  Those that do brave the route (and manage to survive) can find a small, secluded valley situated at the heart of the mountain pass.  In the center of the valley, in a cold and desolate place where plants and other foliage have no earthly business existing, juts a massive tree over three hundred feet tall.  The tree itself is a holy shrine of Silvanus, the Oak Father, the God of Nature and patron deity of Druids.  It was he who planted the seed and nurtured this giant oak thousands of years ago when Faerun was first born.  The shrine was intended to stand as a testament to the raw power of nature, a monument to its ability to thrive in the face of adversity.  For generations the devout followers of Silvanus have tended to the tree, and eventually the shrine became an oracle of sorts, a mystic site where druids throughout the realms could come and seek insight and revelations that would bring them closer to understanding the harmony between nature and man.  It was not until the past thirty to forty years that explorers first discovered the Pass and, subsequently, the little valley that housed this massive tree.  Tales soon began to spread about the unusual warm weather in this hidden valley, warmth that seemed to emanate from the tree itself.  It was only a matter of time before settlers began to arrive, seeking to build homes in a place that was obviously so close to the Gods.  

At first, the druids sought to protect the holy site from the settlers.  The Archdruid in charge of the shrine at the time saw the settlers as an affront to the sanctity and seclusion of the site.  For years the druids kept the settlers at bay with barriers of thorny brambles and various druid tricks that kept the common folk in fear of the place.  Ultimately, their efforts were in vain.  Despite the druids' success at keeping the settlers away from the tree itself, they still would not leave the valley.  It wasn't until the succession of Archdruid Tolben, that the situation in Kuldahar Valley finally changed.  Tolben, unlike his predecessors, believed that the settlement of the valley was not only inevitable, but it was actually the will of Silvanus.  He believed that druids had been wrong in keeping the settlers away and that the Oak Father had intended people to share in the miracle of the Great Oak from the beginning.  When he finally became Archdruid, he formed a plan to fulfill the destiny of the sacred site by bringing about a union between the Great Oak and the settlers.  It was this union that the Archdruid Tolben believed would achieve the harmony the druids had been striving for generations: the harmony between man and nature.  As it stands, Kuldahar is a monument to this vision.  The tree and town exist in a natural symbiosis where it is next to impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins.

As with the small fishing town of Easthaven, Kuldahar became the focus of the terrible war that raged in 1281 DR, the Year of the Cold Soul.  Great storms raged across the region, cutting off the Pass, and the circle of warmth around the great oak receded, forcing many of the inhabitants of Kuldahar Valley to abandon their homes and take refuge within the town.  Until Hrothgar's expedition from Easthaven finally arrived to rescue the town from the forces brewing in the Spine of the World Mountains, it seemed that the great oak would be destroyed and the town of Kuldahar would be buried in the great snows blanketing the region. 

Today, Hrothgar's body is said to lie buried in a glen within Kuldahar Pass.  The names of the heroes that traveled with him and saved Kuldahar have long since been lost, but their deeds live on, evidence of the persistence and strength of the people of the North.~
@28394 = ~The greatest legends can stem from the humblest beginnings, and so it was with the band of adventurers that began their journey in the fishing community of Easthaven thirty years ago, 1281 Dale Reckoning.  Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the East, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.

The misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors.  Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. 

The brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye.  Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day.  Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. 

Among their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North.~
@28395 = ~If it had not been for the rise of the barbarian king Wylfdene thirty years past and the terrible events surrounding his campaign against the Ten-Towns, Lonelywood would most likely have been forgotten by most of the North.  Straddling the rocky shores of Maer Dualdon and the alpine forest of Lonely Wood from which the town borrowed its name, Lonelywood has the dubious honor of being the northernmost settlement in all of Faerun.  The town lies in the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, and the solitary mountain peak acts as a barrier that shelters both the town and forest against the harsh winds that blow down from the Reghed Glacier.  Although the town is protected from the wind, the weather is hardly temperate.  Snow still covers the ground nearly year around, and at night the temperature drops below freezing.

Lonelywood is one of the youngest of the Ten-Towns.  It was only in recent years that it was recognized by the council as the tenth town.  Eighty years ago, there was nothing in the way of civilized settlements north of Termalaine and the area surrounding the Lonely Wood was rife with logger camps and lone trappers.  With the establishment of the Whistling Gallows Inn, however, Lonelywood gained a sense of permanency, and a small town slowly grew up around the Inn.

Not surprisingly, commerce in Lonelywood revolves around lumber.  The Lonely Wood is the only respectable forest in all of Icewind Dale (hence the name, Lonely Wood), and all the lumber and byproduct in the Ten-Towns not imported from the south originates from Lonelywood.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of wood is imported from the south, which explains why Lonelywood remains such a coarse and isolated community.

Its isolated position in the North makes Lonelywood vulnerable to attacks from the barbarian tribes that dwell in the icy plains surrounding the Ten-Towns.  It was the first of the towns in the path of the barbarian king Wylfdene and the united tribes of the Bear, the Elk, and the Great Whale in their campaign to drive the townsman from the North.  When Wylfdene was defeated by a band of adventurers from Kuldahar, the tribes scattered, and Lonelywood returned to its day-to-day routines not long afterwards. 

The Whistling Gallows still stands to this day, and the tree outside the Inn has become a post for travelers to carve their names into when they stay the night in Lonelywood.~
@28403 = ~This book looks to be a recent work, compiled by a mage named Orrick.  The date listed on the cover of the book claims it was written in 1297 DR, fifteen years ago.  The script within is written in a tireless, steady hand, and it looks to be part of a larger volume of works.  The last page contains a passage worthy of note:

"...when the elven fortress of the Severed Hand was shattered by Larrel's attempt to lay a Mythal, both the elven defenders and the armies of the horde that had invaded the halls of the fortress were reduced to shades, doomed to fight a never-ending battle within the great hand.  It is something of a intriguing thought to consider what would have happened had Larrel's attempt to lay the Mythal had succeeded, but such speculations can be linked to other speculations concerning the fall of the fortress, including the severed ties with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep, and the growing mistrust between the two races in the face of the threat the horde represented to the two kingdoms and of the North.  It cannot be forgotten that, if taken in perspective, even though it cost of the lives of his people, Larrel succeeded in his goals, for the Mythal served to break the back of the Horde's thrust into the Spine of the World.

It is the theory and practice of the Mythal that intrigues me and many other scholars to this day.  Was it arrogance that led Larrel to believe he could cast such a powerful enchantment believed to be possible only with several archmages working in unison, or was it *truly* possible, and it was only the presence of the Horde within the halls of the Severed Hand that led the enchantment astray? When I first came to the North it was to seek out the Severed Hand and find the remnants of Larrel's work, but it wasn't until a band of glory seekers from Easthaven traveling the region found the ruined elven fortress for me and retrieved a tome from its library that I was truly able to embark upon my research.  After confirming that the adventurers had made it safe to walk the halls of the fortress again, I abandoned my tower in Kuldahar to the elements, set Weenog on his way (with instructions to return to his tribe and cause no mischief), and traveled northwards to the fortress." 

The last paragraph in the book has been marked in red ink, but there is no note indicating why it was highlighted.~
@28407 = ~The region of Icewind Dale is commonly considered to be the land that lies north of the Spine of the World that has not (yet) been covered by the Reghed Glacier.  The name Icewind Dale stems from the great storms that lash the region, storms that strike with such strength and viciousness that they can level buildings and carry away anything not tied down.  The weather aside, the region is made more inhospitable by the yetis that roam the tundra, along with the great frost giants, polar worms, and winter wolves that inhabit the region in great numbers.  It is frequently said that no sane man travels to Icewind Dale, for it is not the place for civilized folk.  During the past many years, however, it has been a lodestone for explorers, greedy rogues, and hardy souls that seek to start a new life far from the southern kingdoms of Faerun, and it has attracted some of the greatest adventurers known in the history of the Realms.  To say that it also attracts its share of men on the run from the "restrictive" laws of the south would not be inaccurate, and in recent years, in light of the troubles that occurred in the Ten-Towns of Easthaven and Lonelywood, it has also drawn its share of fortune-seekers, treasure hunters, sages, and historians, all of whom are seeking to exploit the history and past conflicts of the region for their own interests.  Many of them do not survive to return home, and ill-prepared curiosity seekers should steer clear of Icewind Dale.

The signposts of civilization in Icewind Dale can be found in a collection of frontier settlements called the Ten-Towns, which are clustered around the three lakes in the region: Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters.  The waters of these lakes are home to a rare species of fish known as the knucklehead trout, which thrive in the icy waters of the lakes and provide the Towns with their main industry: fishing.  The knucklehead trout are known for their great fist-sized heads, and their bones are of such a white hue (and rare enough) to command a price to rival that of the ivory from the jungles of Chult.  Scrimshanders, artisans who carve the heads of the knucklehead trout into sculptures and works of art, are highly respected in Icewind Dale, and there is a great demand for their works as far south as Baldur's Gate. 

If the Ten-Towns has a heart, it is the walled town of Bryn Shander (one of the only two towns of the Ten that are walled, the other being Targos), and this town is the destination of most travelers in Icewind Dale - or at least those who have no interest in the fishing trade.  A narrow trail called the Eastway leads from Bryn Shander to the shores of Lac Dinneshere, where one can find the towns of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig on its western flank, and the fishing community of Easthaven to the south.  Of these, Easthaven has gained the most notoriety over the past years, most likely due to its role in the conflict that struck the region in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR and sealed off the town from its brothers.

The smallest of the three lakes in the region, Redwaters, is the lake that lies to the south of Lac Dinneshere.  It takes its name from the battle waged on the tundra where the towns of Good Mead and Dougan's Hold now stand.  To the west and north is Maer Dualdon, the largest of the three lakes in the region, and the home of the remaining four towns of Icewind Dale that cluster about its shores: Termalaine, Targos, Bremen, and Lonelywood.  The town of Termalaine is widely regarded as the most beautiful of the settlements, with trees planted within the town and walls built around the homes to shield them from the wind.  The town of Bremen lies at the outflow of the river that drains Maer Dualdon into the Shaengarne River and not surprisingly, its position results in a steady stream of barbarians, river traders, and merchants.  South of Bremen lies the walled cliff town of Targos, known for its impressive port (for the region), and the standing Targos Guard, one of the largest forces in Icewind Dale.  The last and northernmost of the Ten-Towns, the logging community of Lonelywood, is known primarily for its logging industry.  Like Easthaven, Lonelywood has also experienced its share of troubles in the past thirty years, and it was feared that the town would be lost when the barbarians began their campaign against the Ten-Towns under the leadership of the barbarian lord Wylfdene in the Year of the Cold Soul.  Despite this threat to the region, Lonelywood survived, and even prospered, growing to export lumber throughout the region. 

Last among the signposts of the region, the great peak of Kelvin's Cairn can be found squatting midway between Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon.  According to Uthgart legends, Kelvin's Cairn takes its name from the fallen frost giant Kelvin Duarol, who was slain by the god Tempus.  As a warning, Tempus is said to have pulled huge rocks from the plain and piled them atop his foe, both to mark his victory and to warn others of what will befall them should they attempt to cross the God of War.  This is one of the many holy sites of Tempus that lie within Icewind Dale, and it is the reason that many priests and temples of Tempus can be found throughout the North.~

@28510 = ~Several hundred years ago, it was decided the elves would establish themselves in the North.  They sought to expand their sphere of influence and they also saw it as an opportunity to place a watchful eye on anything occurring in the frost-covered lands to the North.

The archmage Larrel was placed in charge of this task.  With a strong army at his back and the resources of the surrounding elven kingdoms, Larrel set forth to the Spine of the World Mountains.  Many years were spent making a route to the Northlands and finding a suitable location, and he eventually established an elven fortification in a forest that the elves felt comfortable calling home.  Under his guidance, the outpost thrived and became the elven eye that they dreamt of creating.

It was at this time that the dark horde made their presence known.  A force mostly composed of goblins but within their ranks, some orc and ogre tribes, made their way to the North in search of new lands to rape and pillage.  Inevitably, conflict broke out between both sides as they fought for control of the surrounding lands.

For months, constant battles erupted taking their toll on both sides but neither ever gaining a foothold.  As more time passed, the elves eventually found themselves waning.  Although the elven forces were superior in battle against the ill equipped and untrained horde, they found themselves hard pressed to keep their ranks filled and well supplied due to the long distance between themselves and the elven kingdoms to the south.  The elves of the North were in serious trouble and the horde knew it.  

In what seemed to be a small period of silence to the elves, the persistent attacks of the evil races stopped.  What they didn't know was that they retreated back only to amass themselves into an enormous attack force.  Once assembled, they began their march back towards the elves with the intent of driving them from the Spine of the World Mountains once and for all.  

Weight: 1~
@28516 = ~Not long after Larrel had created his elven fortress in this area, a clan of dwarves had been working on settling a portion of the land as well.  These dwarves came with the hopes of creating another dwarven citadel in the Spine of the World Mountains.   Unfortunately, all initial attempts by these dwarves were met with destruction at the horde's hand.  

This wasn't the first time that dwarves had to deal with resistance from these dark races.  History has shown that the dwarves are very experienced in dealing with this threat.  As their ancestors before them, these dwarves would deal with them in the same manner by utter eradication.

The dwarves gathered their numbers and pushed into the Spine of the World Mountains to rid the area of this threat.  Initial scouts found that the darker races had amassed into an enormous attack force heading west.  The dwarves were smart enough to know that mindlessly attacking the horde would only result in high casualties if not defeat.  They followed the horde from a far and cautiously waited for the right moment to strike.

Weight: 1~
@28518 = ~The elves found themselves under attack again immediately as the horde entered the forest.  The outpost, although designed as a very defendable fortification, began to break under the force of its reckless attackers.  Although the horde was taking heavy casualties, they were winning.  Piece by piece, they were taking apart the elves.  Their outer defenses were eventually breached, and soon after, the main line of defense crumbled.  When all seemed lost to the elves, a battle cry was heard in the distance.

The dwarven force watched in the distance as the horde began to lay waste to this remote outpost.  As they watched, they knew the orcs were completely frenzied with their blood lusted attack to notice what lay waiting behind them.  The dwarves knew this was the time to strike.  With a battle cry that rang throughout the battlefield, the dwarves charged into battle.  The horde was completely caught off guard and the dwarves took full advantage of it.  The dwarves cut down the rear guard with ease and pressed the attack.  The horde's vanguard immediately ceased their attack on the elves to deal with the dwarven threat.  

Given their only chance of living through this battle, the elves marshaled their remaining forces and with renewed strength, began a counter attack.  With the battle turned, the horde was in no way prepared to fight against two fronts.  Every last member of the horde was viciously cut down and thus ended their presence in the Spine of the World Mountains.

@28520 = ~Much to the elves surprise, they never expected to be saved by a bunch of "rock eaters."  As for the dwarves, they never expected to charge into battle to rescue a bunch of "arrogant high elves".  Regardless, victory from a battle of this magnitude was reason enough to see past these petty racial differences.  From this day, a great alliance was formed and together, they formed homes for their people.  For the dwarves, the citadel known as Dorn's Deep was created.  For the elves, the tall fortress known as The Hand of the Seldarine was built.  

200 years passed and the alliance thrived.  During this time, the human settlements also began to grow at an alarming rate, due to their short life spans.  It was also during this time that the darker races began reappearing in the north.  Remnants of the original invading tribes grew to a point where they needed to expand into new territories.

Weight: 1~
@28522 = ~Soon after, a long and fierce debate placed pressure on the alliance.  The dwarves saw a huge potential for wealth by selling some of their great artifacts to the human settlements.  The elves were vehemently opposed to this as they felt the humans were not worthy of such valued creations.  Although they had embraced their neighboring dwarves as comrades, the elves were still isolationists at heart.  In the end, the dwarves grudgingly conceded to the elves on this matter.

Small skirmishes started again between the alliance and the darker races.  Still ill equipped and untrained as before, the alliance spent little time being concerned.  Their complacency derived from the alliance being well established in the region along with the devastating power of their artifacts.  Little did they know that the dark races were entrenching themselves within the recesses of the Spine of the World Mountains.

With new armaments in hand, the large reckless horde of the darker races soon became a deadly force to contend with.  Attacks on the alliance became fiercer and more violent.  Although the alliance still found themselves on the winning side of each battle, they began to take unacceptable losses.  Also more disturbing was the discovery that the horde had within their possession the very same weapons that both races created together.  

Both races of the alliance spent months trying to find a logical explanation to the horde's possession of their magical artifacts.  During this time, the attacks from the dark races became more frequent and fiercer, straining the old ties of the alliance.  Soon, this turned into distrust.  The elves began to insinuate that the dwarves broke their promise and sold weapons to the untrustworthy humans who then sold them for a larger profit to the horde.  The dwarves resented such accusations considering they had just as much to lose from the darker hordes gaining these weapons.  This distrust became uglier as old discriminations of the other race began to surface.

@29180 = ~Mensel of Cormyr, at one time the Lord of Immersea, was that rare sort of nobleman, a fellow well known to be kind, generous, and humanitarian to a fault.  He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands.  Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study.  Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Obscene Grimoire.

Though the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century.  The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.

The unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames.  Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.

The thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion.  Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned.  However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden amongst the illumination around each print.  Those so inclined are able to use the power of Mensel's Obscene Grimoire to summon a cacofiend, bound to the reader's service, one time before the book vanishes.

Barbarians from the Tribe of the Great Wyrm eventually recovered the warrior's body, but chose not to inter his body.  They traded his belt away with the rest of his equipment.

Unfortunately, Tamjan was called upon repeatedly to assist his father in the expansion of their family bakery.  To establish a reputation among the cities of the north, Tamjan would magically preserve the freshness of his father's baked goods as he whisked them away to important events from Luskan to Silverymoon.  Tamjan hated assisting his father.  It made him the butt of jokes in wizardly circles across the north.  Tamjan eventually decided to hire a group of bandits to attack him and his father as they traveled to Luskan.  The young mage believed that the attack would scare his father into giving up his outlandish plan to establish bakeries across the north.  The bandits became overzealous in the execution of their role.  Weeks later, all the Neverwinter scouts found were Tamjan's magical bracers lying in a puddle of slush.

@29589 = ~This bent-looking buckler was fashioned as a replacement kneecap for a deaf-mute stone giant named Gohji who lived in the Sunset Mountains many decades ago.  Gohji was a peaceful sort, avoiding trouble when he could and only occasionally straying from his cave to gather new stones to shore up his home and forage for food.  It was during one of his foraging expeditions that he surprised a group of dwarven miners of the Brueghor Clan who were new to the region.  Before Gohji could raise his hands to show he meant them no harm, an enchanted warhammer shattered his knee, causing him to plummet to the ground.  When the dwarves advanced to finish him off, they were brought up short by the giant's tears and they found they could not bear to kill their now-helpless foe.  They brought a healer to mend his wounds, and then took Gohji (now dubbed the "Sad Giant") back to his cave.  Over the next several weeks, the dwarves brought him food and forged a magical cap for his knee to help him walk again - they called it the "Sad Giant's Cap," and the friendship between the Brueghor Clan and Gohji was mortared in history. 

Gohji and many of the Brueghor Clan were eventually slain during an invasion of gnolls and ogres into the Sunset Mountains, and the Sad Giant's Cap was pried from his bloody body by the gnolls of the Burning Eye Clan.  The cap has resurfaced in the North in the hands of a merchant from Bremen, kept as a novelty, and then was lost again when goblinoids sacked Bremen and advanced south to Targos.

Unfortunately, just as he was placing the final enchantments on the item, Delnar's mother entered into the room, saw the dart, and said "Careful, ye'll put an eye out with that."  Much to his dismay, his mother's words became a part of the enchantment.  The dart did seem to work as intended, but occasionally would strike the user blind upon its return.

Shortly after Hagnen was crushed to death in the great quake of 1275 DR, Hagnen's wife proceeded to lay her husband's name (and backlog of uncompleted work) to rest by finishing the last of a series of enchanted weapons that still lay in Hagnen's workshop, cursing each one with Hagnen's name.  After finishing the last of his weapons, Miraenna apparently left the dwarven clan home and traveled southwards, gladly ridding herself of the Odestone name and creations.

@29989 = ~There is little doubt that Dullcobble Tweed was the worst carpenter in the history of the profession, and an even worse weaponsmith, but his continual boasts of his great skill and insight eventually caused his fellows to challenge him to make a throwing axe worthy of his boastful claims.  Dullcobble, realizing he had to back his proud words, agreed heartily... but inside, he was struck with fear that he would fail the test.

Dullcobble made several attempts to fashion a chopping axe, most of them ending up as cordwood next to his fireplace.  In the day before his challenge was to be called due, his only surviving weapon was a lop-sided axe whose haft was widely overbalanced. Realizing that displaying such a weapon would make him the laughing stock of the community, Dullcobble hired a wild mage to take his misshapen axe and turn it into a serviceable weapon.  The mage shrugged, took his payment, and promised the axe to Dullcobble on the dawn of the next day.  When Dullcobble woke up in the morning, the misshapen axe lay on his doorstep, unchanged, and he had no choice but to take the axe to his challengers... and take his chances. 

When Dullcobble brought it into the town's meeting hall, the axe's appearance was greeted with derision and laughter.  Dullcobble, his face burning, became so angry he threw it at his tormenters - and watched as the haft traveled over the blade's head to smash into a pillar and shatter it, causing the roof to collapse.  Dullcobble, slack-jawed with surprise, was knocked unconscious by a falling timber, but the other challengers made it outside without injury.  

Dullcobble's blow to the head was a serious one, and it turned him into the village idiot - not much of a change from his previous lifestyle.  The axe itself was tossed upon a merchant cart headed north, and it was never seen again.  Whatever the enchantments the wild mage scrawled on the axe did, it causes the haft to be the first to strike an opponent, doing crushing damage instead of slashing damage.

As the years passed, however, the town executioner eventually found a willing mistress in one of the town's brothels who seemed untroubled by his profession, and he paid her numerous visits over the following months.  When the town authorities came to arrest the harlot (who was actually an accomplished thief) for thefts within the city walls, they found the city executioner in her bed and the woman nowhere to be found.  The executioner was implicated in her escape, and his own axe was used to behead him in the town square.

@30025 = ~This longbow is the subject of legend among the squabbling citadels of the Sword Coast, a legend fiercely debated in drinking halls and taverns in and along the storm-lashed coast.  According to the tale, the bow takes its name from its pivotal role in the escape of a young woman named Sophia, a typical maiden fair who was pledged to marry the son of Duke Hugh Gladegrin (the son is described as hideously ugly and of foul temperament, of course).  Sophia, however, believed she was destined to marry one of the Duke's archers, a dashing young golden-haired fellow who roamed the surrounding lands felling foul beasts with a single twang of his mighty bow.  As the tale goes, one of the court wizards (a transmuter) took pity on the young woman's plight and cast a spell that turned her into an arrow for an hour's time.  The transmuter arranged for Sophia to be fired from the castle wall to a ship waiting off the coast, where she could sail to freedom. 

The tale then breaks down from here, as numerous accounts claim that Sophia did not flee the coast safely, and that she transformed back into her normal body while she was halfway across the water, plunging into the icy ocean.  Another school claims that, while in arrow form, Sophia pierced the side of the ship, then choked to death when she resumed her normal form with her neck embedded in the ship's hull.  Still others claim that she was never even launched from the bow, and that she resumed her normal form while inside the archer's quiver, and she awoke, naked, wearing only the small band of leather about her body. When this last argument is made, the discussion generally deteriorates into a steady stream of sexual innuendos and the evening officially goes downhill. 

Whatever the tale, the bow has a range unmatched by many other bows in the realms, and the arrows launched from it strike far and true - unlike the story surrounding the bow.

Upon the blade was inscribed "Know thy family," and Thomas took the motto to heart.  Bolstered by the sword and his mother's loss, he became determined to find Kresselack - whether out of a need for a new family to belong to or to take revenge on Kresselack for abandoning his mother, it is not known.  

When he found the Black Wolf, Kresselack spurned the young man, claiming that the sickly and weak-looking Thomas shared no blood with him, then ordered him beaten and left beneath the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn to die.  After two days in the freezing cold, Thomas was rescued by a tribe of Uthgart barbarians fleeing Kresselack's army.  Nursing the man back to health, the barbarians adopted Thomas into their tribe and he eventually became one of their greatest hunters.  When he passed away from winter chill many years later, he left his sword to his youngest son to help him find his way in the world.

This blade was reputedly given to a local warlord who sought to challenge the shogun, but the shogun was so contemptuous of the warlord's pretensions of being a threat that he invited him to his court and gave him the blade to both insult the man and as a warning for him to know his place.   

When drawn, this short, silvered blade has a broad base that tapers to a sharp point, but despite its apparent lightness, it is actually quite heavy.  It always looks like it is standing at attention and it has a curious way of drawing the eye in combat, unbalancing and distracting any opponents it meets in combat.

@30059 = ~Kellem Longeyes was a noted ranger in the town of Bremen, trekking far and wide across the Savage North in pursuit of his prey.  Kellem hunted wyverns, drakes, and other wyrms of all sorts, especially those that made to attack the Ten-Towns or their outlying settlements.  The grizzled ranger took many trophies - in time, little of his equipment was not adorned with one kind of wyrm or another.

Kellem's most prized trophy, though, was from Frostmaw, a great white wyrm whose size and ferocity matched that of a true dragon's.  While in its death-throes, Frostmaw's jaws and icy breath took Kellem's left eye and ear - for this, the grim ranger swore vengeance on all its cursed ilk.  Upon his return to civilization, Kellem had Frostmaw's wide jaws fashioned into an elaborate helm and imbued with the white wyrm's deadly breath.  This helm the ranger christened "Wyrm's Maw."

Alas, in time Kellem grew old as all men do, and one day set out on a dangerous hunt in the peaks of the Spine of the World never to return.  Until now, none of his equipment has ever been found.

Kellem's helm is made from thick hide, bone, and heavy gray-white scales.  It covers the face and head entirely.  Aside from cutting a dashing figure, the helm's bearer may bellow out a roaring blast of deadly cold once per day.

@30062 = ~This wicked-looking throwing knife is part of a set of items once belonging to Suhailah el Khaba - the Black Lamia - an infamous sell-sword from Calimport.  The unverified rumors regarding her final fate are many, running the gamut from "imprisoned beneath the earth by a vengeful wizard whose niece she'd murdered" to "fell in love with a nobleman from Thay and went into hiding."  What is known for certain is that the murderous woman is long gone and her belongings have been found scattered here and there throughout the realms ever since.

Forged of dull black steel, the blade is engraved in the fashion of a barbed tongue while the handle is textured with minute scales.  Because the enchanted dagger whips back to the thrower's hand once it has struck a solid object, its barbs can do horrendous damage to a target.  Many a bravo were felled by the Lamia's Tongue before coming within ten paces of her, their last breaths escaping through a burbling, crimson hole in their throats.

When Sulo and crew made to steal the Leberm family jewels from a small transport ship off the coast of Port Llast, they found themselves confronted by a group of experienced adventurers hired on as guards.  One in particular fought like a devil, wielding a matched set of finely wrought dueling blades.  The unnamed adventurer slew many of Sulo's men and, coming to clash with the corsair captain himself, severed Sulo's left hand.  "Baron" Sulo would have died that day were it not for a stray ballista round from the Leberm ship - the enormous spear struck the unlucky swordsman squarely and carried him over the side of Sulo's ship in a flash.  All that remained of him was his elaborate parrying blade, left spinning on the deck as if he'd never been there.

Sulo elected to graft the swordsman's parrying blade to the stump of his left wrist in the place of a common hook.  When Sulo was killed some nine years later, the blade was interned with him in a concealed tomb along with a substantial quantity of gems and coins.  Despite the "secret" nature of Sulo's final resting place, the site was quickly plundered and Sulo's Hook passed into hands of other men.

@30072 = ~Belib the Wary was arguably the best-equipped adventurer the realms had ever known - or would have been, had he ever actually left his home on one.  Just one item from his astounding list of enchanted dungeoneering equipment is his Everlasting Torch.  A magical lantern fashioned in the shape of an elaborate wooden torch, the item burns with a bright orange flame that cannot be extinguished - whether dunked in water, buried under several feet of rock, or smashed over the head of a soggy marsh-troll, Belib's Everlasting Torch simply will not be put out.

When Belib finally finished the last of his items, he crammed them all into a giant pack - enchanted to hold far more than Belib could normally carry himself, of course - and heaved it onto his shoulders, prepared for the adventure of a lifetime.  As Belib crossed the threshold of his dwelling he tripped... and the tiny gnome was instantly crushed beneath his enormous backpack.  The bag burst open, its contents scattering across the Waterdeep street where Belib had lived and rapidly vanishing into the hands of various good-for-nothing passersby.

Belib's corpse was eventually taken to a temple and raised by a kind-hearted priestess, but by then the last of Belib's enchanted items... and most of the contents of his home... were long gone.  Grateful but understandably upset, Belib fashioned a number of unique magical items for the priestess before returning to his family and homeland, forever vanishing from the surface world.

@30083 = ~The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Death is an orcish weapon through and through.  Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe.  After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal.  It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.

Prying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it.  Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled.  The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.

Grubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly.  Kaylessa was said to have then coolly ducked as Grubrun's own axe came whirling back at him and cleanly severed his head, rotten yellow tusks and all.

Big Death is an especially large axe - almost ridiculously so - and is only identifiable as a throwing weapon because its short haft and the manner in which it's weighted.  In fact, the axe is so massive that it cannot be thrown with a single hand, requiring the wielder to grip it with both hands and hurl it sidelong with the strength of their entire body.

@30710 = ~Ryomaru was one of the greatest spies and assassins of the Kumo clan of Kozakura in Kara-Tur, and his Harmless Staff is anything but.  Most of its hollowed length consists of a series of compartments holding poisonous powders, spring-loaded darts, weighted chains, jutting spikes, entangling hooks, and various other concealed weapons.  When used in combat there is always a chance that one or more of the staff's nasty little "tricks" will be sprung upon an unwary opponent.  However, great care must be taken in its use - the weapon can easily harm the casual wielder.

Ryomaru himself carried the staff on only three missions, eventually leaving it in the care of the Hojori Temple - a Kumo clan front - and moving on to even more cunning and dangerous weapons.  When the renowned thief "Chicken" Wu Wei - so named for the falcon tattoo on his chest - burglarized the temple, the Kumo were quick to uncover his involvement and track him back to his homeland in Shou Lung.  Wu Wei was forced to flee across the sea to escape their wrath, prompting the dispatch of three more bands of Kumo assassins: one to cross the Eastern Ocean to find Wu Wei, a second to slay the original group that had failed to catch him in Shou Lung, and a third to torture and then execute Wu Wei's every living relative.

"Chicken" Wu Wei retired comfortably on the coast of the Western Heartlands, running a small tobacco shop and only occasionally thinking of his father in Shou Lung, a gambling drunkard who'd beaten Wu Wei's mother and only sister to death when he was a child.  When the Kumo assassins at last caught up with Wu Wei, there was naught but a tombstone - the Daring Chicken had sold every last bit of stolen Kumo treasure and died a happy old man.

@31154 = ~Absolute Self started out as very ordinary studded leather armor worn by an even more ordinary thief named Milton Sixtoes (so named since he had six toes on his left foot).  Milton belonged to a local thieves guild in the mining city of Mirabar, and thus was tasked with petty thievery of coin purses and the occasional gem.  

All was well enough by Milton's ordinary standards, until one day when a thief of notable magical prowess transferred to Milton's guild.  The guild master assigned this new thief to be Milton's partner in crime, aiding him in his petty, but profitable dirty deeds.  Little did Milton know that his new partner was not satisfied with petty thievery.  In fact, it was his partner's higher ambition that almost got Milton in trouble with the local authorities.  During thieving assignments with his new partner, Milton began to perform very risky acts of larceny, and not through his own will.  It was as if someone else had control of Milton's body and used him to carry out the acts.  Luckily for Milton, he was able to perform the higher risk activities, but he knew that one day his luck would run out.

So, one day when Milton was feeling more proactive than usual, he took the day off from thieving and ventured to a Dwarven armorsmith who resided in one of the upper Mirabar mining tunnels.  There, with his extra earnings from unwillingly performing his more dangerous thieving, he commissioned the dwarf to upgrade his studded leather and give it the power to ward off other's charms.  The dwarf complied and ended up upgrading Milton's ordinary studded leather into fine, extra tough studded leather that made the wearer immune to the spell Charm Person.

Not long after Milton began wearing the armor, he discovered his new partner was the one who cast the spell Charm Person on him and made him take all the extra risks.  The last time his partner tried to charm Milton, he (Milton) played along as if he were charmed, snuck up behind his partner, and slit his throat with an ordinary, poisoned dagger.  From then on, Milton was very pleased to go back to ordinary, petty thievery, though no more partners were ever assigned to Milton Sixtoes.

Cut from the enchanted flesh of a zombie, studded with silver and blessed by the witch doctor, Mizelle donned the unusual armor and immediately felt increased magical resistance.  Unfortunately, one of the side effects of Mizelle's new armor was a zombie curse that made her very socially unappealing.  However, she was so desperate to destroy the necromancer, she did not care.  With the ability to resist the necromancer's death spells, she cut him down with the ferocity of a demon.  Soon afterwards, she went to a cleric of Sune and had the cursed armor removed, never to be used again by the wild elf ranger.

While a skilled scout may be able to slink undetected around a camp of regular soldiers and bandits with ease, the same cannot be said if the camp the scout is observing is protected by detection magics.  It is because of this very reason that the armor known as Interloper was created.

Many generations ago, skilled wood elf craftsman perfected a technique that was able to combine powerful non-detection magic into leather armor. Using this armor, wood elf scouts could infiltrate even the most well protected campsites without fear of being discovered by any magical means. Unfortunately, one of the scouts grew careless and was captured as he was spying on a drow raiding party. After days of torturing their prisoner, the drow were able to learn how the scouts were able to infiltrate their camps and even the location of the village at which these special armors were being made. Needless to say, every man, woman and child in that village was ruthlessly slaughtered...except one. This particular Interloper armor managed to survive only because the individual who wore it was away from the wood elf community the day the drow attacked.

@31178 = ~Drakkas Ranul was an outcast Moon Elf with a huge chip on his shoulder.  At a very young age, Drakkas was kidnapped by a Drow raiding party and brought up by the Drow to be a pit fighter.  At first he fought his fellow kidnap victims in the pits.  However, over time, his fellow abductees died from their wounds and poor treatment, thus leaving Drakkas alone to eventually fight monsters of the Drow's choosing.  Drakkas persevered, fueled by his ever-growing hatred for his captors, the hopes of one day escaping and then taking revenge on his kidnappers.

One day Drakkas got his wish - he was able to escape by stealing his jail cell keys from his lazy night guard, and then stealthfully slipping out into the unforgiving Underdark.  He managed to steal a couple of scimitars on his way out, which he put to good use while circumventing the twisted corridors of the Underdark.  When he emerged on the surface, he immediately sought out his Moon Elf kin. 

Unfortunately, when he found his kin, they ostracized him due to his horrendous battle scars.  Embittered and outcast, he made it his mission in life to exact the most painful revenge possible on his kidnappers.  Drakkas diligently trained in the dark magics, and continued his formidable weapons training as well.  When he got to the point where he felt he was ready, he began to sell his services as a mercenary to earn coin and buy better equipment.  One thing in particular he eventually wanted was lightweight chain mail that would not interfere with his spell casting.  Luck was with him the day he found a Dwarven armorsmith who could accommodate Drakkas' needs.  It was not long after until the armor was finished and Drakkas was ready for his mission of revenge.  

Drakkas disappeared from the people who knew him and utilized his mercenary services, and ventured into the depths of the Underdark, where he was never heard from again.  However, his special armor did somehow make it out of the Underdark.  No one knows how, but speculation has it that the return of Drakkas' chain mail to the surface world was a subtle message from the Drow.  The message, of course, was left to the imagination of the interpreter.

@31358 = ~Maya Selvinis was a solitary half-elf ranger who lived on the outskirts of Neverwinter.  Feeling different and un-whole due to her breeding, she rarely had any interaction with other people except when she was summoned to aid in a crisis.  Although she did not care for the company of others, she was more than eager to aid those in peril.  However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.

One special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever.  An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock.  Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods.  After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees.  In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard.  The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond.  Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in.  The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric.  The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection.  In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.

Maya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came.  The cleric shouted back, which startled Maya, and declared that she understood more than Maya could ever know.  It was at that point that the elderly cleric revealed herself to be Maya's mother.  Maya again scoffed, stating that her mother died long ago.  The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude.  The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within.  Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always.  Then, in a brief flash of light, the cleric was gone, leaving Maya to stew with the wisdom of the old cleric - her mother.

Maya thought on what her mother said, and soon tried to implement her mother's wisdom.  After a few months, Maya found her inner sanctuary, and became more powerful because of it.  In fact, that power was also absorbed by her splint mail armor.  All those who donned Maya's splint mail felt a peace flow through their being.  People found their own personal sanctuary within that armor, which soon became known as Sanctity.

Common to these clerics are their amazing plate mail armor that grants them several advantages over necromantic spells such as Paralyze and Death Magic. Clerics of Myrkul may make it their practice to aid in the affairs of the dead, but they have no desire to prematurely die themselves.

@31395 = ~Plate and full plate are arguably the toughest armor in any realm.  However, no one can deny that full plate is susceptible to crushing damage.  In fact, most bludgeoning weapons were created with the intention of blowing through full plate armor. 

With this thought in mind, the armor known as Diamond Cut was forged.  No one is exactly sure how Diamond Cut came into existence, but what is known is that the renowned Mirabar armorsmith, Cutter Boomstock, one day unveiled the armor to a well-to-do knight who traveled all the way from Amn.  Diamond Cut glistened in the firelight like a thousand diamonds, almost blinding was the intensity of the sheen.  And, in a remarkable demonstration, Cutter Boomstock lifted his anvil high in the air and struck the armor.  To everyone's amazement, the strike left no mark on the sparkling armor.   

The knight happily took the armor and left Mirabar forever, never to be seen again.  However, his armor, Diamond Cut, has been seen from time to time, leading people to speculate that the elaborate knight met an untimely death.

@31398 = ~No one is certain where the Plate of the Pit Fiend came from, or how it was created.  Its spiky red scaled plates radiate a fiery red glow at all times, convincing those who look upon it that the plate mail is certainly otherworldly.  

Those that equip the Plate of the Pit Fiend find that the plate has a deadly natural defense when struck too many times.  If an enemy is too successful with their strikes against the wearer of the Plate of the Pit Fiend, the plate will emit an explosive burst of flame in all directions around itself.  This flame mortally wounds everyone caught within its wake, except for the wearer of the unusual plate mail.  

It is rumored that the Plate of the Pit Fiend is actually the hide of a Pit Fiend, killed and skinned by someone, or something, more powerful than a Greater Baatezu.  If this rumor is true, pray to the gods that the creature capable of killing and skinning a Pit Fiend never comes to the material plane.

@31403 = ~Aasimars are direct offspring from a union between mortal and celestial minion.  While normally carrying innate powers, it is not unusual for an Aasimar to don blessed armor.  Such is the case for this unique armor known as Aasimar's Aura.  The armor shimmers with a silvery glow and is adorned with exquisite blue etchings across the breast.  One look at the armor and it is simple to see that it possesses powerful protections.

Long ago, the Blood War between the Baazetu and the Tanar'ri spilled over to the material plane.  Luckily for most of the world, the battle was far away from any major towns or cities.  However, this was still no comfort for the Celestial beings that watched over the material plane.  So, it was quickly decided to amass as many Celestial and Aasimar beings as possible and drive the Blood War back into its own abyssal planes.  However, because of the great numbers of Tanar'ri and Baazetu, the Celestial beings permanently blessed all the Aasimars' armor with Protection from Evil.  This spell allowed the Aasimars to get in close to the evil creatures without getting attacked.  Once all the Aasimars were in position, the Celestials gave the order to attack, which completely surprised the hordes of Baazetu and Tanar'ri.  The ensuing battle raged for days, with high casualties on both sides, but eventually the evil hordes were pushed back into their abyssal planes. 

As a result of the high Aasimar casualties, it was not uncommon for looters to take the armor off the dead.  So, from time to time, a set of Aasimar's Aura will pop up in a shop, or on an adventurer who could afford the high purchase price.

@31529 = ~Cleaver is not a fancy weapon.  It was crafted with a single purpose in mind: the felling of ones enemies.  The four foot blade is crafted of plain steel.  The hilt and guard are unadorned and purely functional.  Overall, Cleaver appears cheap and inconsequential.  

The true beauty of Cleaver is discovered in battle.  Despite its large size, the weapon is surprisingly light and easy to wield.  The enchanted blade bypasses all armor and strikes directly at the life force of its target.  Unfortunately, it is incapable of affecting any creature without said life force.  Therefore, undead and constructs are immune.

Cleaver was originally crafted for Dwelnar the Pious, a warrior who aspired to become a paladin.  He demanded that the blade be plain and unobtrusive, reflecting his own humility.  Only in battle would the weapon show its worth.  Unfortunately his enemies soon learned the nature of the blade and unleashed a horde of undead against him.  Dwelnar quickly fell in battle and the sword was lost.

When the elder brother was named king by his dying sire, the younger was furious and vowed to take the throne as his own.  To this end he commissioned the making of Silentkiller to aid him in his brother's murder.

Unfortunately, his mother had a habit of interrupting him at crucial points during the enchantment process, often with disastrous results.  Death's Bane is another botched attempt by Delnar to construct something of use.

This weapon is truly an enigma.  When used in battle it does little to no damage, instead healing the intended target.  However, the healing is miniscule at best and hardly worth the effort required to swing the blade.  In any case, it has been given the name 'Death's Bane' because of its inability to slay a target.

Fiery runes writhe along the length of the haft, almost as if they have a mind of their own.  The haft is capped with a pommel stone, a blood red garnet.  The weapon sports two heads, each the visage of an unknown but demonic looking creature.  The eyes of the heads glow red and a sulpherous odor seems to emanate from the mouths.  The heads appear to be crafted from lumps of coal, and yet are as hard as steel.

It is heavy even for a shield of its size, much of the weight coming from a large sculpted dragon's head set into its face - the head, wrought in the same red metal as the rest of the shield, protrudes almost like a gargoyle from a castle wall.

The head is the likeness of Red Fang, one-time mount of a tyrannical warrior-king from a land long ago forgotten.  When Red Fang was slain in battle, the warrior-king had the beast's soul bound to this shield so that the faithful dragon could still accompany him into battle.  Once per day Red Fang's iron head can breathe a gout of searing flame at the shield-bearer's command.

@31596 = ~This odd pole-arm appears to be a cross between a halberd and a warhammer, fitted with a four-pronged hammerhead and a long thrusting spike.

Its creation was the result of a blunder made during the commission of an enchanted item for Lodur the Brave (alternately known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard), a powerful but none-to-bright cleric.  Lodur had of heard rumors of a mighty long-hafted hammer, possibly wielded by a hero known as Lucerne, or perhaps that's where it was made, which may or may not have had to do with a land or king or deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or "something of that nature, I am most certain."

"Oh," he had then added, "and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead and what-not, so that I might smite things most explosively."

Lodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time.  The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker.  The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.

When Lodur the Brave returned to the dwarven stronghold to pick up his new hammer, he found instead a spiked pole-arm whose use was forbidden by his religion.  The cleric ranted and gnashed his teeth and swore up and down the halls of the clan before stomping off in disgust, leaving his payment and the somewhat inappropriately named "Lucerne Hammer" behind.

@31748 = ~Lady Roa was a woman thrice betrayed.  First by her lord father, who married her to Duke Sorim for political gain despite knowing that he would relentlessly torment young Roa.  Second by her abusive husband the duke, who planted assassins amongst her handmaidens... when Roa visited her dearest brother Remin - a powerful baron - the assassins murdered him as he slept and so his lands passed to the duke.  The third and final betrayal was at the hands of her sister Rana, who longed to take the duke, his riches, and eventually the royal crown for her own.  Rana entwined herself in a plot with Duke Sorim to slay the king, discredit the true heir as his bastard child with Roa, and thereby steal the throne.

Roa, still less than sixteen summers old, was bound with a ball and chain and cast into the duke's infamous dungeons to await the completion of her husband and sister's terrible scheme.  She sobbed and moaned day and night, her voice echoing through the keep's halls.   The duke soon grew incensed at her constant wailing and sent one of his Ducal Guard to beat little Roa into silence.  When the man arrived at the cell, he struck her across the face, shoved her to the ground and made to kick at her belly - but quick as that, Roa sprung up and strangled the man with her chains.

Moments later the willowy young girl burst into the duke's court and attacked him savagely.  His guards pelted her with bolts from their crossbows, but onwards she charged.  When she reached the Ducal Throne she tossed Sorim's champion aside like a broken doll, swinging the iron ball of her shackles with such strength that it stove in the shocked duke's thrice-enchanted breastplate of meteoric iron, driving shards of shattered ribs into his lungs and heart and killing him instantly.

No one is clear as to how the tale ends - some say that Roa then expired on the spot, her chest and back bristling with bolts, while others describe how her sister Rana leapt up and killed her with a dagger... a few optimistic souls even claim that Roa lived and spent the rest of her days in peaceful bliss.  Whatever the case, her shackles remain as a testament to her story.

The chains of Roa's shackles have been looped and wound together in such a way that one can wield them as a flail.  Crudely etched into the soft iron of the ball are the words "In Righteousness Lies My Strength."

@31882 = ~"It was during Borab the Reaver's sacking of the Blue Citadel that Alemis Peacemaker - youngest son of Earl Marimor Peacemaker, lord of the Blue Citadel - stole into the locked vault his father had thought so well-hidden.  There, alone in the cavernous chamber, were Wroth, Hateful, and Furious - the dread sword, axe, and armor of Hurom, ancient ancestor of Alemis, once known as the Bloody Juggernaut before he broke his cursed iron's spell and took the Peacemaker name."

"Alemis, a mere boy, donned the fell armor and took Wroth and Hateful in hand.  Alone he cut his way through Borab's motley horde of humanoid raiders until he faced the towering half-giant himself, hacking him down and scattering his army to the wind.  His family - father, mother, brothers and sisters alike - had all died by then, but Alemis no longer cared.  He stalked the realms, eyes ablaze with madness, slaying monsters and brigands wherever he found them.  But as the years passed and Alemis found no more of such wheat to thresh, he took to turning his thirsting blades on all who crossed his path... and so, once more, the Bloody Juggernaut had returned."

  -- from "Master Pelib's Bedtime Tales"

This heavy, unadorned bastard sword of dull gray steel is a cursed thing, only showing its true form when the wielder is wounded in battle.  It is then that the hilt sprouts crimson tendrils that bury themselves in the wielder's forearm; drinking his or her blood, the demon-sword opens the three glaring eyes along its twisting, dripping blade and drives the wielder mad with lust for bloodshed.

Should a warrior carry Wroth along with its brothers Hateful and Furious, his or her soul would be lost to the hell-forged arms and armor.  To wield even Wroth alone might be construed as insanity... but there will always be those for whom it may be just the weapon they're looking for.

@32007 = ~This long scroll of parchment contains the alchemical notes of D'hey-jazerrion.  The notes are quite extensive, but there are four items of interest: 

- D'hey-jazerrion seems to have had some recent trouble restoring the lever in the southern section of the ziggurat chamber, which is vital to all the alchemical operations below.  There is some indication that he intends to return soon to fix it, and it looks like he is the only one who can.  There haven't been any notes made in the past few days, so he may be due back soon... it looks like all one can do is wait for him to return to fix the lever. 

- D'hey-jazerrion has numerous notes on the creation of "wyvern poison," and the process appears simple enough for even an unskilled alchemist to perform.  Take a wyvern's stinger, lay it upon the westernmost bench in the lab, then proceed to the lever (mentioned above) south of the ziggurat in the chamber north of the lab.  From there, simply pulling the lever will cause the stinger's venom to be distilled into the various beakers in the lab.  After half a minute, the procedure will finish and the alchemist can unlock the distiller with the lever - if the lever is not unlocked, green lights (signifying the distillation procedure is still active) will flash around the tables, and the labs cannot be accessed.  When the process is complete, every stinger placed upon the bench should be distilled into a bottle of wyvern poison.  D'hey-jazerrion appears to perform this process frequently... but there is no mention of why he does this. 

- The notes also contain a great deal of D'hey-jazerrion's schedule.  Apparently, he is not always within the lab, and he prefers to let some of his mixtures sit for several days to ensure their purity, whether they need it or not. 

- Most interesting is the steps required to create the yuan-ti histachii, or "brood guards."  The majority of the steps detail the creation of a histachii brew that transforms a humanoid into the creature.  With these notes, a skilled alchemist could perform the procedure in the lab where they were found.  The alchemist would have to execute the operation themselves to ensure the reagents are pure, but the procedure is quite simple.  Mandrake root must be placed on a prepared distilling table (which, according to the notes, seems to be the easternmost table in the center of the lab - it should already have a number of histachii potions on it).  Once that has been done, the alchemist must pull the lever (mentioned above) in the southern part of the ziggurat chamber that lies north of the lab to activate the distiller.  After half a minute, the procedure will finish and the alchemist can unlock the distiller with the lever.  The histachii brew can then be removed from the table.

Because only a portion of the mandrake is used, a single sample can create many fully potent brews.

NOTE: While distilling the wyvern poison can be done with no training, only a character possessing these notes and above a 15 Alchemy skill can successfully distill the histachii brew; otherwise the player must enlist the services of someone skilled with the procedure to distill the brew... either by intimidating or tricking them.  It also looks like the lever in the ziggurat chamber to the north must wait for D'hey-jazzerion to return to fix it before any of the alchemical processes can take place.~ //lore 15

An azure rod slowly draws in and collects the power of Goodness itself, using the energy to both harm evil creatures and invigorate the rod's bearer.  Oddly enough, though, the rod functions perfectly well in any hand, whether that of the holiest of priests or darkest of scoundrels.

@32081 = ~Ancient dwarven legends tell of a time when the noblest of metals was not dwarven steel, nor meteoric iron, nor mithril, but dykhast - an alloy so strong that a blade's edge would never dull with toil or battle, and with a surface so perfect and gleaming that its shimmering surface could be seen a dragon's flight away.  The oldest of dwarves speak of dykhast blades with tears of fond remembrance in their eyes, and callously spit at the mention of the "sundry weak and piddling'" metals that today's arms and armor are fashioned from.

There are rumors, though, of an ancient and secret temple called Chogoh Kyn - it is there, the tales say, that blades of dykhast are still made in the fashion of days long past.  The price may be high, but for the true connoisseur, there is no matching the glory, the perfection, the utter joy... of dykhast.

The entire weapon is as black as pitch and reflects no light; its grip is textured with a delicate web pattern while hundreds of tiny spiders are engraved along the two-foot blade.  The short sword's dark magic not only protects the wielder from the effects of magical webs, but can entangle a target with webs of its own as well.

An assassin typically uses the weapon to seal a target in a cocoon of silk, stepping away from their thrashing foe to complete the murder with a poisoned dart or wrist-crossbow bolt.  Such weapons have also helped many a would-be assassin flee from something that they've backstabbed but failed to kill with a single blow.

Eventually, a league of merchants hired a pair of brother wizards, Dashrim and Balkat of Dragon Falls, to stop the assassin before he worked his way through their high council.  Dashrim and Balkat ambushed the assassin and dispelled his enchantments.  When they finally killed him, they pulled back the man's mask and found that his face had been horribly disfigured in a fire.  Strangely, divination revealed nothing about the man's history or clients.  The brothers kept the boots for a few years and eventually sold them.  Because they did not know the name of the man they had killed, they simply called the items "Shifter's Boots".

Her powers of trickery, seduction, and acrobatics were praised and cursed with equal frequency.  She wore these slippers in her home in case unexpected visitors dropped in.

Rakavik was a clever man, and devised these bracers knowing that most people assume bracers are for protection.  When opponents thought Rakavik was out of spells, he never needed to pull out a wand or staff to make a quick offensive action.  He simply made a non-threatening gesture with his arms and activated these polished steel bracers.  Despite being over two hundred years old, the large sections of black enamel on the bracers are still dark and shining.

Rakavik died in 1012 DR when he and his fellows botched an attempted burglary in Suzail.  The bracers have passed through many hands since that time.

Believed to have had contact with Arrakon, the would-be conqueror of Icewind Dale's barbarians, Arkamadis was only slightly less dedicated to dominating the native people that surrounded his tower, Whitestone Talon.

Arkamadis wore a pair of bracers during most of his time in the north.  Regardless of the disguises he used, he always kept the bracers as an identifying feature.  The bracers were made of thick, polished bronze.  Though not elaborate, the top of each bracer featured a lion rampant in relief, roaring towards his hands.  Arkamadis lost his bracers when dwarves from Citadel Adbar crushed his growing empire and demolished Whitestone Talon with siege engines.

Despite the brevity of the battle, some historians claim that the torture inflicted upon the wizards lasted for weeks.  This particular robe was worn by Jamal Briars, a professor of alchemy.

Some historians mutter in the margins of their writings that the wizards may have been attempting to construct an item similar to the ill-fated Crown of Horns.

It is out of one such simple life that the legend of Behem Farmer of Mistledale emerged.  However, the circumstances surrounding his legend are far from typical.  While tending his farm near Sword Creek, bandit riders from the east rode forth and told him to surrender his land.  Behem was overcome with grief and could not answer them.  The leader of the bandits told Behem that he had until dawn of the next morning to vacate the land.  The bandits then rode towards other farms and told them the same thing.  At dusk, as the farmers cleared out their homes and prepared to fall back to defensible ground, some of the families saw the silhouette of Behem standing in his field, leaning upon his hoe, his head hung low.

In the evening, three farmers approached Behem's field and saw the farmer asleep in his field.  More shocking was the apparition of a woman, believed to be the spirit of Chauntea, wrapping Behem's loose cloak around him.  The farmers returned to their families and told everyone what they had witnessed.  Bolstered by the belief that Chauntea had blessed Behem for staying on his farm, the farmers gathered up their families and marched back to their farms.  Unfortunately, their bravery had returned a few moments too late.  Behem had just been killed by the bandits for refusing to leave.  Before the eyes of the farmers, thick vines erupted from the field the bandits stood upon.  The vegetation not only held the bandits firmly in place, but also thrashed and choked them into unconsciousness.  The farmers rushed forward and drove off the bandits who remained.  Though Behem's body disappeared with the vines, his bloodstained, tattered cloak remained behind.

Legends say that the Black Goat appeared to a nameless halfling village that had been sacked by goblins during a terrible winter.  The tribe of warriors slew most of the halfling men, burned the fields, and took all of the town's livestock.  Broken but not hopeless, the villagers congregated for prayer in the burned chapel at the center of town.  Out of the smoke drifting over the edge of town, a black goat appeared with six kids, five black, one white.  Over the course of six days, the kids grew, gave birth to more kids, and each previous generation died in the night.  The milk, meat, and hide provided by the goats helped the halflings survive through their harsh winter.  After the six days of miracles had passed, the town tanner made a belt from the hide of the mother goat that had appeared out of the smoke.  Halfling tales often contain stories of halfling heroes wearing the Black Goat Girdle on their adventures, though no one has yet determined exactly where the legend truly originated.

Forged from the finest metals and enchanted with the darkest magics akin to Xvimian lore, the Xvimian Fang reflects no light from its blackened steel.  The blade is so black, in fact, that any details that usually stand out from a curved dagger blade are completely absent.  It is as if the blade actually absorbs light. 

Saablic Tan always keeps the Xvimian Fang close, not just because the dagger has the awesome power to potentially turn individuals to stone when attacked, but because the dagger actually increases the wielder's intellect - truly a powerful weapon befitting a powerful wizard.

The Monkey Paw of Discipline looks exactly like the name describes.  It consists mainly of a large, petrified monkey's arm severed at the shoulder.  At the shoulder joint, it looks like a one-handed grip was jammed into the bone and magically fused. At the opposite end, the paw is open and is the main dealer of pain.  Once someone is smacked with the paw, aside from the considerable damage, there is a chance that the recipient of the discipline will suffer from heightened fear and/or confusion.

Those that have met Pustule the Sick feel the unquenchable urge to immediately bathe because of his disturbingly filthy and disease covered state.  Even Pustule's weapon of choice, a large, grotesque flail, secretes filth and disease.  

Pustule's Flail does not have a clean spot anywhere.  Every square inch is covered with weeping sores and green tinted muck.  This probably explains why whenever Pustule the Sick uses his flail in battle, the disease that covers both him and his weapon transfers to the victim of the flail's impact.  And, if by some extraordinary reason the recipient of the flail's fury does not get diseased, then they will most surely get poisoned.

Its exquisitely crafted mithral hammer is much larger than most warhammers, yet seems no heavier.

Little is known about the origins of this sword, but Mulhorandi aristocrats have passed its rumor from generation to generation.  According to legend, whenever a human Mulhorandi woman gave birth to a girl after having been forced into slavery, she would, on the night of the first full moon, pray to the ancient pharaoh Tyrish for guidance.  Hearing her prayers, Tyrish would send "floating down from the heavens" this weapon, originally no larger than a stiletto, and the woman would use it to severely disfigure her child.  Once the deed was done, the weapon would enlarge slightly before floating away as gracefully as it had arrived.  These "marked" children, now deemed undesirable by their male overseers, would be allowed to purchase their freedom, thus sparing them the horrors of slavery.  The scars inflicted upon these children - those physical in nature at least - would eventually heal over time.

@33197 = ~It is rare that the residents of the Ten-Towns willingly interfere in the affairs of the native barbarians.  Occasionally, the townsmen cannot help but come across a landmark or religious site that the barbarians erected.  Twenty years ago, Sammel Colger of Bremen was fishing near the Sea of Moving Ice when he discovered the remnants of a small barbarian ship.  He was drawn to a particular piece of the hull that had a colorful painting on the side.  As he pulled the wood from the water, a polar bear leapt up from the depths and struck at the young man's head.  Instinctively, he pulled the wood towards his face.  The bear's huge talons were deflected.  Amazingly, the creature slipped and fell back into the cold water.  Not hesitating to see what the bear would do, Sammel rushed back to his small ship and returned to Bremen.  A priest of Tempus later told the young man that the painting was of a sacrificial virgin.  He believed that the small boat must have drifted all the way from Maer Dualdon to the Sea of Moving Ice, where it was smashed to pieces.  Sammel had the wood fashioned into a shield, which he took with him on his far-reaching fishing trips until the end of his days.

On the rare occasions that groups of dwarves appear on the tundra, they are typically gathered for battle.   The leader of the Warcrest clan always kept a keen-eyed warrior armed with Mailripper by his side.  The warrior's instructions were simple: shoot the most heavily armored opponent you see approaching the king.

When the Warcrest clan was wiped out in a woeful conflict with barbarians, some warriors from Bryn Shander used it for idle target practice before they died en route to Redwaters.

Ricarl wanted to get Makavail in trouble without letting his target know it was he who was responsible.  When Makavail was exiting Westgate with chests full of stolen goods, Ricarl shot the leg of one of the horses pulling Makavail's wagon.  The horse bolted and overturned the wagon.  Guards rushed to the scene and discovered what Makavail was up to.  He was thrown in prison and died only a year later.  He never knew who had fired the fateful bolt that caused his downfall.

The citadel's gates are magically sealed, nigh impossible to open from without.  The drow had intended to assault the citadel's guards, prompting them to open the gates to summon more thralls and thus expose the citadel interior.  However, with the arrival of so many driders in the area, the gate guards withdrew into the citadel and have yet to return.

Malavon is certain that if the number of driders can be reduced, the citadel guards will return to their position at Z'hinda's gates.  To this end, he planned to find and destroy whatever it is that is responsible for the driders' sudden increase in numbers.~

@34456 = ~Hiepherus Note: 

This scrap of parchment, burned around the edges and smelling faintly of bloodweed incense, seems to be a daily log of some sort:
- - - 
The visions began when I pledged Bane's strength to Isair and Madae, and I now know Bane has placed a test before me - to test my devotion to his cause against my service to the Legion of the Chimera.  Could it be he thinks I hold Isair and Madae's words with more weight than his doctrines...? I MUST prove him wrong.  The visions show an ancient blade that has slain six... six companions of vile hearts who were once in Bane's service in the distant past.  The six were known as the Lost Followers, and from what I can see in my visions, they now lie in screaming prisons upon the Ethereal Plane.  If they are to be set free, the blade MUST be recovered and destroyed... if I cannot find it, then I fear I shall join them in their undead prisons. 
- - - 
I have come to the glen shown to me in the visions, but the accursed blade that murdered the Lost Followers eludes me! Something within Kuldahar is preventing my scrying efforts, and without the visions to guide me, I cannot hope to recover the consecration medallion and tear the blade from the graves within the Glen... whichever damned one it is! Give me something to KILL as my challenge, not this endless hunting and searching, and I will prove that I serve Bane's will!
- - - 
In a fit of rage, I have raised many dead in the Glen to do my will and used my powers to tear answers from them, but of the blade and the medallion's fate, the dead know *nothing*... but speak much of the serpents that have passed through the valley of late.  Could it be that somehow Cedra or one of her half-breed minions secured the medallion and even now hold it in one of their chambers, unaware of its true purpose?!  If so, I may need to wrest it from them by force... which would break my allegiance to the Chimera and destroy everything that we have worked for.  Is it Bane's will that the Chimera's spine be broken? But the potential of their strength... allied with Bane, of course... would bring the North and the lands beyond to its knees! The elves, dwarves, humans, all crushed, burned, their ashes scattered to the winds! But, I must be mindful - the will of the Black Lord is not for me to question... or to know. 
- - - 
It has been many days, and I have sent the dead into the Valley to slay whatever humans they can find.  Yet... with every day that passes in the Glen, I can feel the presence of the Lost Followers, clawing at the material plane, waiting to be freed.  I fear that simply finding the blade will bring them howling to this place... and they may be beyond all reason when they are summoned.  If so, then I had best have Bane's protections about me, or else the Six will level Kuldahar and the lands around in revenge for dying at the blade's hands.  I may be forced to destroy them against my Lord's will.  Could that be my challenge? Whatever the reason, I MUST find the blade, and find it soon, before its powers are unearthed by one who stands against the Legion of the Chimera... and Bane... and if the blade should find its way into the hands of a holy warrior, then ALL is lost.

Blood in the Black Lord's name,
Hiepherus, D- *

*You notice that where the title "Dreadmaster of Bane" would be next to Hiepherus' name, the parchment has been blackened to ash, as if it was held over a candle... or exposed to the far-seeing eye of Bane's disfavor.~
@34458 = ~Perhaps the yuan-ti did not know what they held in depths of Dragon's Eye, but simply holding this item reveals its long history to you, and its saga is a long and bloody one indeed.   One only needs to hold the medallion close to them, close their eyes and concentrate upon it, and the chronicle of the medallion scrolls through your mind.  

This notched stone was once set into the pommel of the ancient blade Cera Sumat, a Holy Avenger wielded by old Duke Kholsa Ehld as he walked upon the path of the Lost Followers, challenging them to answer for their crimes in the Barbed Kingdom.  Inscribed upon the stone is the chronicle of his search for the six Lost Followers, and the circumstances surrounding their deaths.  The medallion tells of the six:

Ehld met Inhein-Who-Was-Taken as she slept beneath the earth on the Battle of Bones and asked her to follow him to the Barbed Kingdom to be judged.  Her laughter was a storm of bladed whispers, and she cursed the old man, hurling spells of death and flame upon him... she surrounded herself with mighty magics and swirling blades, daring the old man to come close, but he simply bowed his head and took shelter within the spiritual shield of his holy blade.  In fury, she risked much and began to raise the dead from the Battle of Bones to destroy the Duke, but the shield around him prevented them from getting close.  The undead, furious at their summoner for putting them to an impossible task, turned upon their mistress and tore her apart.  Ehld took what was left in a small metal cask and took it to the highest hill at daybreak, and let the sun shine down upon Inhein's remains until they were dust.   

Broken Khree, one of the only monks to fight the Black Raven in combat and survive with only his legs shattered and his jaw splintered, was the next of the six, and he was not hard to find.  He had gathered together a band of slaves captured from a number of small farming hamlets and had them build a temple in Bane's name.  Khree was a master of unarmed combat, with eyes and reflexes so quick that he could dodge most missiles and spells before they stood a chance of touching him - and he had sent many archers and mages to their graves.  In hand to hand combat, he was a terror, for his bones and body were one with the elements, ignoring fire, cold, lightning, and weather's other displeasures, and while his skin could be stabbed or cut, his bones had the strength of the earth about them, preventing them from being broken or crushed by all but the most powerful of attacks.  Ehld knew this, and when he found the bloody monk, the two traded no words, but attacked each other immediately.  It was all Ehld could do to dodge Khree's attacks, but in a dangerous stratagem, Ehld tricked Khree into collapsing the newly-erected temple of Bane around them, causing Khree's arms to become pinned by the falling masonry.  The monk died as the falling crossbeams of the temple pierced his chest, and in the last minute of his life, he spat his defiance against Ehld and told him he would fight his way back from death to destroy him. 

Kaervas Death's Head was the lord of an empire deep within the earth, and he sat upon his lava-red throne of rock and lava, his skin so thick with calluses and black enchantments that no mortal weapon could pierce or cut it.  Ehld traveled many leagues beneath the surface of Faerun and demanded an audience with the black rock king.  Kaervas, amused by the old human's challenge, agreed to fight him, but found Ehld's strength and holy avenger an equal match for his strength and skill.  Finding it almost impossible to strike a mortal blow against Kaervas with even his holy avenger, Ehld parried one of Kaervas' strikes and turned the momentum of Kaervas' own axe back on its owner, causing the blunt end of his mighty axe to sink into the dwarf's skull, splintering the bone beneath the skin into fragments.  The Duergar allowed the human who had slain their king to leave unmolested, and they sealed Kaervas' body in the throne room where he died.

Atalaclys the Lost traveled upon the great sands of Anarouch, hoping to unearth some of the ancient magics buried within the desert to stave off the rotting disease which had claimed him.  Ehld tracked him down through the shifting desert, meeting him in the sandy square of a dead town.  With no living creature as their witness, the two of them fought for days, spell against blade for days, until at the height of the fourth day, Atalaclys's rotting throat cracked in the desert heat.  Unable to utter a spell to carry him away, Ehld left him in the desert, where his corpse lay, fed upon the flies and beetles of Anarouch. 

Jaiger of the Fanged Season had once been one of four Uthgart brothers whose father had blessed each of them with a binding of the elements.  Jaiger had been bound to the Elemental Plane of Air, and such was his power that he could harness the wind to pull his bowstring - and cause the missiles and spells of his enemies to go astray.  Jaiger was serving as a mercenary in one of the many southern kingdoms, his bow firing out a stream of arrows so fast and sure that he was said to bring a Rain of Death wherever he traveled.  Ehld found the toothless barbarian within the brothels of a southern port, half-drunk and belligerent.  When confronted, Jaiger was too deep in his cups to realize who Ehld was, and once it suddenly sunk in the old man had come to capture him, Jaiger tried to fight back with his bow - only to find it much more difficult to fire with his opponent standing almost on top of him than it was when the opponent was a horizon's distance away.  Although Jaiger sunk many arrows into his opponent, Ehld was able to best him with a whirling strike that severed Jaiger's bow... and the barbarian's throat.  

Veddion Kairne, the Hunched Lord, was the last and most difficult of Ehld's challenges.  Kairne was said to be the spawn of a storm giant and a demon, combining the great strength of his father with the cunning and bloodthirstiness of his mother.  No fork of lightning could touch him, no fire could burn him, and it was said that he bathed in acid and frost as if it were water.  The two bloods coursing through him had given him a tremendous resistance to magic, but it prevented him from using magic himself, forcing him to walk the face of Faerun whenever he wished to travel the land.  Instead of awaiting his death, however, he sought out Ehld as he was traveling upon the Spine of the World Mountains and tasked the old paladin with proving him guilty of the slaughter in the Barbed Kingdom.  The two of them dueled with words for many hours atop the Spine of the World Mountains until Ehld finally tricked Kairne into admitting his guilt... and the Hunched Lord laughed and their battle begin.  Hurling jagged boulders at the elderly warrior, Kairne buried Ehld under an ever-growing mountain of rubble, then lifted up his hammer to drive the tombstone into the makeshift cairn around the old warrior... only to have the cairn collapse beneath him, causing an avalanche and crushing him beneath its great weight.  Ehld, who had been crouching within the cairn and using his sword as a brace against the precarious balance of rocks, had slipped free and let weight and gravity take their course.  With Kairne, the last of the six had been silenced, and Ehld returned home to his Queen. 

When he arrived in the court of the Barbed Kingdom, Ehld detached the medallion from the pommel of his Holy Avenger and gave it to his Queen to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.  

If this medallion could somehow be brought to the resting place of Ehld's Holy Avenger, the blade will rise from the ground, ready to be taken up against the forces of evil once again. 

Weight: 0~
@34460 = ~The holy avenger is the paladin's ultimate weapon against the forces of evil.  There are few creatures on the Lower Planes that would not hesitate to confront a holy warrior wielding such a weapon... and this one, perhaps more so than others.  Once, it was nothing more than a simple iron sword, but through the courage and faith of one man, it became something more.

The blade of this holy avenger glows with a soft golden light.  Inscribed upon the hilt in flowing gold letters is "Cera Sumat," which translates into "Six, now Silenced."  Cera Sumat earned its name through the labors of elderly duke Kholsa Ehld, a man cresting nearly eighty years of age, who vowed to complete a task that the greatest warriors of three kingdoms feared to do... all because of the weeping of a child. 

The times in which Old Duke Ehld lived were ones of great upheaval, and the servitors of Bane were strong, crushing all that stood in their way.  Entire kingdoms feared their wrath, and to speak out against them meant death, so many remained silent and turned their eyes from the evils of Bane and his servants. 

During these dark times, the most terrible of Bane's minions were six who called themselves the Lost Followers.  Their souls were storms of avarice and hate, and mighty were the powers at their command.  They reveled in strife and tyranny... and for all the blood they shed, it was never enough.  

Together, the Lost Followers brought about the downfall of the Silver Court, slaying its king upon his throne and renaming his once-beautiful nation the Barbed Kingdom.  After animating his decapitated corpse and having it march through the streets slaying anyone it could find, they brought a rain of fire down upon the city and the lands around, leaving it a barren wasteland.  It is said that they dined in the capital's great hall that night as the land burned, and they raised their wine glasses as the screams of the dying reached their peak. 

There was only one survivor.  In their last act of malice, the Lost Followers left the king's only daughter, barely five years old, alive to reign as "Queen" over the burned kingdom.  They called her the Weeping Queen and cast wards about her so that she might never leave the empty capital, and then left her to starve.  Their appetite momentarily slaked, the Lost Followers parted ways and went upon their separate roads of damnation, sowing strife in the Bane's Name.

Old Duke Ehld was the first one to cross the wards of the Barbed Kingdom and seek out the Weeping Queen upon her father's throne.  When he found the small girl, he approached, kneeled before her, and told her he had come to pledge his life in her service.  In stiff, formal words, he said he had brought food and water and apologized for his lateness, but his bones were old and it had taken him some time to reach this place.  The near-starving child stared at him as he pledged his worn blade and his honor to seeing that the ones who had done this terrible crime answered for their actions, if his Queen wished it.  After a long, stunned silence, the Weeping Queen found the words to thank him.

From the moment Ehld left the throne room in search of the Lost Followers, the weeping of the queen ended, and she never wept again. 

Over six years, Ehld traveled the lands of Faerun and across the planes themselves, seeking the Six, and asking them to answer for their crimes.  Each scoffed at the old man and his worn-looking blade, only to find him a dangerous opponent... and in the end, the victor.  He recorded the events of their death upon a stone set into the pommel of his blade, and there was even regret in his writings that he had not been able to enlighten the Lost Followers to turn from their path before it came to its end.

When the last of the Six had answered for their crimes upon the edge of the Cera Sumat blade, Ehld returned to the Weeping Queen and laid the blade at her feet.  Where once it had been a tarnished blade, it shone as brightly as the sun, and the stone in the pommel was covered with the writing of his journeys.  He detached the stone, and set into a chain, and he gave the Weeping Queen.  Ehld told her to keep the chain to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world and that they are never far from one's heart... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.  

Duke Ehld outlived his queen, living to the age of 107, at which point Ehld took his Cera Sumat and left the Barbed Kingdom... and is said to have traveled north.  In time, the Barbed Kingdom rose to its former glory and its name was changed, and with it, the fate of Cera Sumat and the Medallion of the Lost Followers was forgotten... until your arrival in Kuldahar and the medallion and the Holy Avenger were united once again to meet the Lost Followers in battle one final time.  

But the story of Ehld and Cera Sumat was a story of another time, and of the adventures of another hero.  This is now your time, and your epic.  If your band counts a paladin among its number, then this ancient blade is yours to wield against the forces of evil...  

And perhaps, if your heart is true, save a land from destruction once again.

@34792 = ~In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand.  But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that.  

Initially used to help in the training of students at the Kamjin-Doh, these Bands of Focus radiate a soft moonlight glow when the light of dusk falls upon them.  While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier.  On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called, "distractions") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent. 

Many of these bands were scattered throughout Faerun in the wake of the destruction of the Kamjin-Doh at the hands of the Master of Razors.  It is rumored that the Master of Razors possessed a set of these bands as well, but their location remains a mystery.

@34796 = ~Few have heard of the (literally) short-lived underground movement against the Hosttower of the Arcane called the Circle of Ice - nor the rings that came to mark the members of the organization, both in life and in death.  

The Circle of Ice was sponsored by a merchant from Waterdeep whose name has been burned from recorded history by the Hosttower.  Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun.  Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower.  These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. 

Ironically enough, the merchant never wore one of these rings, which was key in exposing and defeating the movement.  As soon as he returned to Luskan, his mind picked apart by telepaths and his movements scried, and each wizard slayer and accomplice were noted, identified, and ultimately led into deathtraps where their rings proved no match against the summoned monsters and arrows of slaying wielded by the ambush parties.  It is rumored that only one wizard slayer, Martek, escaped the Hosttower, and to this day, he has never been found, which has been a constant source of irritation to the mages. 

In any event, the Circle of Ice died a quick, silent death in Luskan, but the merchant lived on as a toy of the Hosttower, serving them until death, at which point, his corpse was stored in their laboratories.  It is most likely his preserved body will end up as the left arm of a flesh golem named Bok many years from now. 

These small bands of Cold Reflection appear to be made of crystallized ice, very cold to the touch, and they cannot be seen by a wizard unless the wizard knows they are there. 

If your band contains one that fancies him or herself a wizard slayer, perhaps these rings may be used for the purpose they were intended... but without the shortsightedness of foolish merchants handicapping your efforts.

These simple medallions carry a minor blessing that allows a soldier to achieve a measure of peace even in the middle of combat, allowing him to steady himself to face the trials ahead.  These medallions are highly prized by soldiers that deal with the Uthgardt, especially when trading turns sour, and it seems blood is about to be shed.  

When the goblin horde sacked Bremen, this mysterious item was seized from a dead merchant by one of the goblin shamans, who could find no use for it.  The medallion was carried for several leagues until the amulet slipped from the shaman's possession and was lost amongst the snows, only to resurface here.

@34812 = ~This belt of woven hair is a curious belt, and it is woven from a mix of red dwarven hair and verbeeg giant hair.  It was originally worn as a substitute by the "Little Giant," Hohn Burninghair, an ill-tempered dwarf who swore to kill a hundred giants after several raids by greedy verbeeg wiped out much of his caravan trade from Upper Dorn's Deep.  Soon after his proclamation, the Little Giant went in search of verbeeg camps, fighting them one after the other, until he came across the Temple of the Forgotten God in the mountains bordering Kuldahar.  It was said that he was brought into the Temple, and rather than risk more bloodshed, the priests agreed to reign in the verbeeg patrols from around Dorn's Deep and made reparations for the stolen goods.  Somewhat mollified, Burninghair left his woven belt in the hands of the Temple and swore peace with the verbeeg provided they kept their end of the bargain.  When the Temple was ransacked many years later, the strange belt was carried off by the attackers and lost in the North. 

The Little Giant belt grants the wearer tremendous strength, most likely as a side effect of the giant hair woven into the belt and the great anger that ran deep in Burninghair's heart.  It is said that Burninghair's original belt that predated the Little Giant was much more powerful, but he lost it while pursuing a fleeing verbeeg across a river - apparently, the verbeeg was attempting to carry off one of the Burninghair's ponies.  Furious over the loss of his original belt, Burninghair simply added its loss to the list of crimes the verbeeg would pay for.

@34817 = ~It can be argued that the Arc of Gold and its sister, the Mithral Arc, brought about the end of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North many years past, and led to the destruction of the Severed Hand and the fall of Dorn's Deep.  Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. 

At the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North, a disagreement arose between the two races over the matter of trading enchanted weapons to the men of the south, who were beginning to establish a foothold in the North.  The dwarves were of the opinion that the many great works that had been built through the joint efforts of the dwarves and elves should be offered up to man and the profits used to fill the coffers of both races.  This suggestion was not well-received by the elves nor by their leader, the arch-mage Larrel, and the matter was quickly dropped. 

However, when the Arc of Gold, one of the items fashioned jointly by dwarven and elven weaponsmiths was found in the hands of an orcish war party not long after the debate in the alliance councils, the elves accused the dwarves of selling the weapons to the goblinoids out of greed.  The dwarves, insulted, broke the shafts of their hammers in the middle of the council and broke talks with the elves, returning to their halls in Dorn's Deep and never speaking to them again.  The two races, now divided, were soon swallowed by the Dark Horde that was devouring the North beneath its banner. 

At the time of the fall of the Severed Hand, the Arc of Gold was mounted within the halls of Severed Hand as a reminder of the dwarven treachery and dwarven greed.  When the Severed Hand fell, the Arc of Gold silently watched as the goblinoids tore apart the elvish defenders and laid waste to tower after tower, until the elvish archmage Larrel, in a desperate measure, brought about the Mythal cataclysm that sealed the fate of the Severed Hand once and for all.  

When the Mythal was cast, the Arc of Gold vanished from the halls of the Severed Hand and has not been seen since... until now.

He created magical items that literally saturated the gamut of possible situations that could arise from his high adventures.  These magical items would have been the envy of all adventurers, had Belib been successful in leaving his domicile with his equipment.

After many years of creating his incredible inventory of enchanted do-dads, Belib finally gathered his wares into an immense backpack (naturally, it was enchanted to carry far more than what would normally fit into a gnome's pack) and set out to quest for the grandest quests.  Unfortunately for Belib, one of his tiny feet tripped over his home's threshold and he was summarily crushed under the enormous weight of his pack.  The backpack burst open and scattered his enchanted wares all across his front yard.  One would like to think that passing sentient beings would stop and help the crushed gnome, but the most that passersby did was loot Belib's goods.

One of Belib's more popular goodies, especially with the vermin that make stealing and looting a career, was Belib's Multiple Tool.  Disguised as an ornate amulet, this tool would help make even the most inept rogue a master of lock picking and trap disarming.

@34885 = ~Aeryl Goldenbeard was a particularly flamboyant pirate that sailed the seas off the coast of Amn.  He was the captain of the pirate warship, The Bouncing Rhonda; a twenty gun cutter that was considered one of the fastest vessels on the high seas.  Those unfortunate merchant ships that crossed paths with The Bouncing Rhonda were never able to outrun the cutter, were summarily boarded and their merchandise stolen.  

Now, the fact that Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard and his hearty men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully pirated ships was not so unusual.  No, the unusual part was that after the men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully seized a merchant vessel, Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard would come gallantly swinging, via rope, down from the ship's mast and land elegantly upon the deck of the merchant ship.  At almost the same time Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard's feet touched the merchant ship's deck, the captured crew took an instant liking to the pirate captain.  In fact, it was not uncommon for a majority of the captured crews to beg for a commission on The Bouncing Rhonda.  However, the instant the pirate captain and his crew left the merchant ship (along with its cargo), the remaining merchant ship's crew immediately resumed their hatred for the pirate captain.

No one knew why or how Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard managed to charm his victims so well.  That is, not until one day, while the good pirate captain was making one of his famous entrances via rope and mast, his colorful bandana flew off his near balding head.  The second his foot touched the deck, all the former merchant crews that went along with the pirate ship instantly came to their senses and summarily beat the pirate captain to death.  It did not take long for those around to realize that the pirate captain's bandana held magical properties that made him seem more charming.  

Unfortunately for the remaining pirate and merchant crew, the bandana flew into the sea.  However, rumors would pop up from time to time that a particularly dashing swashbuckler had the uncanny ability to charm his way out of trouble and liked to swing from mast ropes - and that he wore a very colorful bandana.

In addition, the barbarian shamans would sometimes create spells that would temporarily imbue the warriors with the dexterity of the snow leopards.  However, since these spells were temporary, often times the spell would wear off at inopportune times.

It is said, however, that a group of barbarian shamans once congregated deep within the Dales to find a way to better harness the swift agility of the snow leopard.  For nearly a year the shamans remained out of sight from their home clans, busily focusing their attentions towards the magic of the snow leopard.  Then one day, the shamans returned to their respective clans, each holding a small necklace made of silver, with a pendant that resembled a snow leopard's paw.  The shamans gave this pendant to their strongest warrior of each clan.  Once placed around the neck of the warrior, the dexterity of the snow leopard filled their powerful bodies.  From then on, the Snow Leopard Charm, as it became known, would become one of the most prized artifacts within barbarian clans.

Seemingly loathed by all and lonely as one can be, the mercenary was said to have suddenly stood up from his seat in a Targos tavern, heaved a forlorn sigh, and wandered off, the nondescript sack seemingly abandoned beneath his chair.  Its magical properties may well have remained forever undiscovered but for a single rat that crept inside to nibble on some iron rations.  The rat was soon followed by a curious, snuffling cat, which was in turn followed by three of the proprietor's barking hounds.  The proprietor up-ended the apparently lifeless sack and, much to the tavern patrons' amazement, the lot of them came tumbling out in a noisy bundle of fur and gnashing teeth.

When the tavern was eventually destroyed in an out-of-control cooking-oil fire, the Mercenary's Sack was sold to a passing merchant to refinance its reconstruction.

According to the debate, the mercenaries were not seen as effective combatants, and certainly not worth the gold they were paid for their meager weapon skills.

Apparently, their ability to predict the future was not listed in their company annals.

@37569 = ~These are the notes of the wizard Imphraili, a specialist in the school of transmutation.  Their contents revolve largely around the theoretical application of the Sanguis Anima - an alchemical fluid she uses in the process of animating a flesh golem - as a means of physically invigorating or extending the lifespan of a living creature.

Imphraili clearly states that the procedure would be insanely dangerous and that only a dedicated practitioner of the art of transmutation could carry it out; it requires the imbiber to magically alter the state of the Sanguis Anima - normally deadly poison to any mortal humanoid - as it courses through his or her blood.

Using these notes and with the proper chemicals - the Sanguis Anima in particular - and access to an alchemical laboratory, a skilled transmuter with a taste for danger could probably perform the procedure.~
@37570 = ~This large, hand-written tome details the efforts of the wizard Imphraili - a specialist in the school of transmutation - to enhance what she refers to as the "languid, wholly inefficient flesh golems of our day."

Most of the book is filled with various alchemical formulae, surgical procedures, chemical treatments and the like to be given to the inanimate golem before it is awakened.  In the final chapter, however, she details the creation of the Sanguis Anima, a fluid necessary in the animation of such an enhanced golem.  Once the fluid is injected into the creature and the golem is blasted with electricity, it will awaken to serve its new masters.  There is a warning, however - the modified golem will not be able to stand the touch of direct sunlight.

Using this tome and with the proper chemicals - the author mentions a variety of giant fungi spores in addition to other more typical reagents - and access to an alchemical laboratory, a skilled wizard or alchemist could probably concoct the Sanguis Anima.~
@37573 = ~This is the progress journal for a project called "Viciscamera."  Scribbled in painstakingly small, cryptic shorthand, it is for the most part entirely illegible.

The most recent entries seem to revolve around the project's success, boasting that the Viciscamera is entirely functional and now requires only the slightest of biomagical alterations to perfect.  The writer seems particular proud of the Viciscamera project's natural and magical defenses... with its tough, ensorcelled hide and exhalation sacs of airborne corrosive gas, the thing seems nigh indestructible.

Hastily scratched notes in a sidebar mention a possible weakness, however: one could possibly create an enchanted poison that would turn the Viciscamera's defenses upon itself, essentially forcing it to self-destruct.  In addition to the required range of somewhat typical alchemical reagents, the author mentions a variety of giant fungi spores and "a curious, silvery fluid similar in consistency to mercury."

Using these notes and with the proper chemicals and access to an alchemical laboratory, a skilled wizard, alchemist, or maker of poisons could probably concoct a magical, specially-tailored conversion poison capable of destroying the Viciscamera project.~

@39137 = ~I thank you, <GABBER>, both for the woman's sake  - and my own peace of mind.  Even as a priestess of Ilmater, the poor woman has suffered enough.  Please, accept these - the wand I fashioned from the oak of Kuldahar, and it is not much, but it may help you in your quest.  The other items may prove of more use.~
@39141 = ~Oh, no, no, <GABBER>.  I give these to you *for* Kuldahar's sake.   The people of Kuldahar who remain have more than enough magic at their disposal - I wish these items to go where they will do the North the greatest good, and that is with *you.*  Now, please, accept this - as your duty, not a reward.~
@39143 = ~Welcome back, <GABBER>!  You have my gratitude... and the gratitude of all Kuldahar - why, I thought your battle in the Western Pass nothing short of epic, but your efforts here in Kuldahar threaten to outshine even your past heroics.

@39287 = ~The serpent is a wind instrument. It usually is made of a long, conical wooden tube of over six feet in length that is coiled in much the same way as a snake; thus the name. Six holes along its length help the player alter the pitch in much the same way as a cornet.

This particular instrument produces a low sonorous sound that can be felt to the very bones of all those within range. In the hands of a skilled bard, this instrument can produce a Stinking Cloud and direct it at one's enemies.

@41420 = ~Thank you for driving off the goblin assault on the Palisade. You were the armor that saved the lives of the people of Targos. I would like to thank you personally by giving you my armor. This mail will serve you well one way or another ... and I have a feeling that you be seeing more action following Ulbrec's orders than I will here guarding the wall.~
@41421 = ~Do you smell dead ... dead fish?~
@41422 = ~Well, t'be honest it smells like dead fish all over Targos. But you're probably just smelling part of my knucklehead collection. I collect artifacts made of fish bones. Scrimshaw, knick-knacks, that kind of thing. I do have a fishbone shield hidden around here that might interest an adventurer like yourself. I'd be willing to part with it for 400 gold. Interested?~

@41430 = ~Why do you have a secret stash of armor, Oswald? Aren't you more of a wizard than a warrior?~
@41431 = ~Why don't you just give me all of that armor, Oswald? Can't you see that my cause is just?~
@41432 = ~Farewell, Oswald.~
@41433 = ~Reason? Oh my, yes, I do have a reason. Why, there's no cosmic rule that a wizard can't wear heavy mail. I think I cut quite a dashing figure in a suit of chain, and Maralie agrees. I would wear armor more often ... it's just that it's so darn uncomfortable. Most armor doesn't seem to be made for a gnome of my gir... er, stature.~
@41434 = ~Right. Well, let's see your stash.~
@41435 = ~You think that just because you're saving the town and the surrounding area from an assault by hellish creatures of pure evil that notaries like myself should give you all of the material aid that we possibly can? That instead of trying to earn a quick coin by charging you money we should be thankful that you're saving our lives? That we should recognize the long-term benefit in helping you out at this critical stage? That we should express our undying gratitude for your selfless actions on our behalf by showering you with favors?~
@41436 = ~You appear to have the essense of it, yes.~
@41437 = ~Amazing! Unlike everyone else here you seem to have a firm grasp of this concept.~
@41438 = ~Most of the time you're a little hard to follow, but in this one area you demonstrate an uncanny clarity, Oswald.~
@41439 = ~You should know by now that that sort of thing never happens. If we give you anything at all, it will be on the order of a rusty dagger. You know that adventurers are expected to sally forth and smite evil bearing nothing more than a loincloth and a grim sense of destiny. I will remain safe behind walls and wish you all the success in the world. Now, would you like to buy something?~
@41440 = ~Somehow, this didn't go quite as planned. Let's see that stash, Oswald.~

You will fearlessly travel North and contact the local temple in Easthaven. In addition, the Elder Swordsman, as if not attaching much importance to this, mentioned that he was "worried" about some omens regarding events in the North. He is sure that if in these troubled times there is still valor and glory, it should be in the service of the Lord of Battle.

It may not be a lot of glory to travel the frozen slopes of the Spine of the World, but you are eager to hit the road. After all, this is an opportunity to show the peoples of the North the courage and valor that came from the cities of the South, as well as to avoid the boredom of daily polishing of the armor of the supreme clergy of the temple. You agree without hesitation; and in ten days you are already on a ship going to the North, armed only with a staff in your hands and loud battle hymns in your heart.~

Once, I asked him what had happened when the Hand vanished on that fateful day. As he looked down from the safety of the mage's tower, he watched chunks of stone fall away and disappear. Eventually, trails of ethereal fire raced up the fingers, leaving lavender smoke and nothing more. When the haze cleared, his tower alone survived, hanging in the sky as a reminder of what once stood at the center of the valley.

Though I barely remember the adventurers now, we all remember how important they were to our lives. They stayed with us for a while longer, but moved with the changing of the seasons. Soon after the heroes had gone, Iselore planted a garden at the base of the great oak. For, he told us, the adventurers' memory should remain associated with the realm of the living. 

And, as I now realize, it is for the sake of the living that I now leave my home. Just as my mentor did when he came here, just as those adventurers did when they saved all of Icewind Dale. There are many roads left to travel, many deeds left to do, before the end of my days.~

@1000022 = ~This hammer is a byproduct of a gnomish inventor's practical joke. Apparently, an industrious little gnome was able to create a special alloy that was capable of retaining a sizable electric charge. He cleverly wove metal strands of this alloy into his leather work gloves and greeted guests with hilariously shocking results. That is until he shook the hands of a passing dwarven weaponsmith. Rumors say the shock was so intense that the poor fellow's beard caught fire. In exchange for his life, the gnomish inventor relinquished the secret to his special alloy to the dwarven weaponsmith, who now makes a comfortable living fashioning various weapons using the alloy.

@1000061 = ~Perhaps the yuan-ti did not know what they held in depths of Dragon's Eye, but simply holding this item reveals its long history to you, and its saga is a long and bloody one indeed.   One only needs to hold the medallion close to them, close their eyes and concentrate upon it, and the chronicle of the medallion scrolls through your mind.~
@1000062 = ~This notched stone was once set into the pommel of the ancient blade Cera Sumat, a Holy Avenger wielded by old Duke Kholsa Ehld as he walked upon the path of the Lost Followers, challenging them to answer for their crimes in the Barbed Kingdom.  Inscribed upon the stone is the chronicle of his search for the six Lost Followers, and the circumstances surrounding their deaths.  The medallion tells of the six:~
@1000063 = ~Ehld met Inhein-Who-Was-Taken as she slept beneath the earth on the Battle of Bones and asked her to follow him to the Barbed Kingdom to be judged.  Her laughter was a storm of bladed whispers, and she cursed the old man, hurling spells of death and flame upon him... she surrounded herself with mighty magics and swirling blades, daring the old man to come close, but he simply bowed his head and took shelter within the spiritual shield of his holy blade.~
@1000064 = ~In fury, she risked much and began to raise the dead from the Battle of Bones to destroy the Duke, but the shield around him prevented them from getting close.  The undead, furious at their summoner for putting them to an impossible task, turned upon their mistress and tore her apart.  Ehld took what was left in a small metal cask and took it to the highest hill at daybreak, and let the sun shine down upon Inhein's remains until they were dust.~
@1000065 = ~Broken Khree, one of the only monks to fight the Black Raven in combat and survive with only his legs shattered and his jaw splintered, was the next of the six, and he was not hard to find.  He had gathered together a band of slaves captured from a number of small farming hamlets and had them build a temple in Bane's name.  Khree was a master of unarmed combat, with eyes and reflexes so quick that he could dodge most missiles and spells before they stood a chance of touching him - and he had sent many archers and mages to their graves.~
@1000066 = ~In hand to hand combat, he was a terror, for his bones and body were one with the elements, ignoring fire, cold, lightning, and weather's other displeasures, and while his skin could be stabbed or cut, his bones had the strength of the earth about them, preventing them from being broken or crushed by all but the most powerful of attacks.  Ehld knew this, and when he found the bloody monk, the two traded no words, but attacked each other immediately.~
@1000067 = ~It was all Ehld could do to dodge Khree's attacks, but in a dangerous stratagem, Ehld tricked Khree into collapsing the newly-erected temple of Bane around them, causing Khree's arms to become pinned by the falling masonry.  The monk died as the falling crossbeams of the temple pierced his chest, and in the last minute of his life, he spat his defiance against Ehld and told him he would fight his way back from death to destroy him.~
@1000068 = ~Kaervas Death's Head was the lord of an empire deep within the earth, and he sat upon his lava-red throne of rock and lava, his skin so thick with calluses and black enchantments that no mortal weapon could pierce or cut it.  Ehld traveled many leagues beneath the surface of Faerun and demanded an audience with the black rock king.  Kaervas, amused by the old human's challenge, agreed to fight him, but found Ehld's strength and holy avenger an equal match for his strength and skill.~
@1000069 = ~Finding it almost impossible to strike a mortal blow against Kaervas with even his holy avenger, Ehld parried one of Kaervas' strikes and turned the momentum of Kaervas' own axe back on its owner, causing the blunt end of his mighty axe to sink into the dwarf's skull, splintering the bone beneath the skin into fragments.  The Duergar allowed the human who had slain their king to leave unmolested, and they sealed Kaervas' body in the throne room where he died.~
@1000070 = ~Atalaclys the Lost traveled upon the great sands of Anarouch, hoping to unearth some of the ancient magics buried within the desert to stave off the rotting disease which had claimed him.  Ehld tracked him down through the shifting desert, meeting him in the sandy square of a dead town.~
@1000071 = ~With no living creature as their witness, the two of them fought for days, spell against blade for days, until at the height of the fourth day, Atalaclys's rotting throat cracked in the desert heat.  Unable to utter a spell to carry him away, Ehld left him in the desert, where his corpse lay, fed upon the flies and beetles of Anarouch.~
@1000072 = ~Jaiger of the Fanged Season had once been one of four Uthgart brothers whose father had blessed each of them with a binding of the elements.  Jaiger had been bound to the Elemental Plane of Air, and such was his power that he could harness the wind to pull his bowstring - and cause the missiles and spells of his enemies to go astray.  Jaiger was serving as a mercenary in one of the many southern kingdoms, his bow firing out a stream of arrows so fast and sure that he was said to bring a Rain of Death wherever he traveled.  Ehld found the toothless barbarian within the brothels of a southern port, half-drunk and belligerent.~
@1000073 = ~When confronted, Jaiger was too deep in his cups to realize who Ehld was, and once it suddenly sunk in the old man had come to capture him, Jaiger tried to fight back with his bow - only to find it much more difficult to fire with his opponent standing almost on top of him than it was when the opponent was a horizon's distance away.  Although Jaiger sunk many arrows into his opponent, Ehld was able to best him with a whirling strike that severed Jaiger's bow... and the barbarian's throat.~
@1000074 = ~Veddion Kairne, the Hunched Lord, was the last and most difficult of Ehld's challenges.  Kairne was said to be the spawn of a storm giant and a demon, combining the great strength of his father with the cunning and bloodthirstiness of his mother.  No fork of lightning could touch him, no fire could burn him, and it was said that he bathed in acid and frost as if it were water.  The two bloods coursing through him had given him a tremendous resistance to magic, but it prevented him from using magic himself, forcing him to walk the face of Faerun whenever he wished to travel the land.~
@1000075 = ~Instead of awaiting his death, however, he sought out Ehld as he was traveling upon the Spine of the World Mountains and tasked the old paladin with proving him guilty of the slaughter in the Barbed Kingdom.  The two of them dueled with words for many hours atop the Spine of the World Mountains until Ehld finally tricked Kairne into admitting his guilt... and the Hunched Lord laughed and their battle begin.  Hurling jagged boulders at the elderly warrior, Kairne buried Ehld under an ever-growing mountain of rubble, then lifted up his hammer to drive the tombstone into the makeshift cairn around the old warrior... only to have the cairn collapse beneath him, causing an avalanche and crushing him beneath its great weight.~
@1000076 = ~Ehld, who had been crouching within the cairn and using his sword as a brace against the precarious balance of rocks, had slipped free and let weight and gravity take their course.  With Kairne, the last of the six had been silenced, and Ehld returned home to his Queen.~
@1000077 = ~When he arrived in the court of the Barbed Kingdom, Ehld detached the medallion from the pommel of his Holy Avenger and gave it to his Queen to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.~
@1000078 = ~If this medallion could somehow be brought to the resting place of Ehld's Holy Avenger, the blade will rise from the ground, ready to be taken up against the forces of evil once again.~
